// Outbox.swift
//
// The per-process durable outbox (design.md D5, tasks 9.1-9.6). Each
// process that can log food -- the app, a widget extension, a future
// Control -- instantiates its OWN `Outbox` backed by its OWN JSON file in
// its OWN sandboxed container. There is deliberately no attempt to share
// this across processes (no App Group exists to share it through anyway,
// per design.md D3's confirmed negative result) -- reconciliation
// (Reconciliation.swift) checks against Garmin, never against a sibling
// process's local state, which is what makes per-process queues safe
// rather than a source of split-brain bugs.
//
// A client-generated UUID is the idempotency key: Garmin's private API has
// no idempotency key of its own (design.md D5), so de-duplication is this
// package's problem, resolved after the fact by Reconciliation, not
// prevented up front.
//
// add-log-entry-editing (design.md D1): an entry may also carry `replaces`,
// the Garmin `logId` it supersedes. Garmin has no edit route, so an edit is
// delivered as "create the corrected entry, THEN delete the old one" --
// never the reverse, so the worst failure is a temporary, visible duplicate
// rather than a lost food. The intermediate `.createdAwaitingDelete` state is
// persisted BEFORE the delete is sent, so a crash between the two requests
// resumes at the delete and never re-sends the create. Both routes are the
// ones this app already used before editing existed (create confirmed
// 2026-09-16; delete per garmin_mcp's live e2e test, docs/garmin-routes.json)
// -- no edit/update route is invented here.
//
// Also add-log-entry-editing: an edit of an entry that is STILL QUEUED (never
// reached Garmin) is a plain local swap (`replaceQueued`/`cancelQueued`),
// guarded against a drain that is sending that very entry at the same moment
// (`OutboxStore.claim`).
