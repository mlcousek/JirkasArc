// BossCatalog.swift
//
// add-weekly-boss-and-streak-freezes design D1: the ten weekly-boss
// archetypes, one per habit the owner can be weakest at, plus the boss and
// freeze badges. Each archetype names
//   - `goodDay`: when a day of the fight is a hit (a shared `DayPredicate`,
//     so the rule means exactly what the same rule means in bingo), and
//   - `isConsidered`: which days count toward its adherence at all (a
//     feature-local filter over `DaySignals`, per the foundation's "wave-2
//     changes must not add DayPredicate cases" rule) -- e.g. water adherence
//     is measured only over days with water data, so missing data never
//     reads as a weak habit.
// `requirement` is the data source the archetype needs before it can be
// chosen at all (`DataRequirement`).
//
// Names are Czech-flavoured: in Czech they are the Czech names from the
// design ("Snídaňový skřet"), in English their English twins. All display
// text is localized here (`bundle: .module`), nothing is persisted.
//
// add-training-gamification-and-150-levels D9: an eleventh archetype, the
// Impatience Imp, exists only in the training experience. Its habit is
// "keep the day's plan" and its hits are KEPT PLAN DAYS -- a rest day and
// resting on a red morning included (TrainingXPRules) -- so it is judged
// from the plan's facts, never from food data: `isConsidered` is false for
// it and its `goodDay` never holds. `BossCatalog.all` stays the ten food
// archetypes (the bestiary badge needs exactly those); the imp is in
// `BossCatalog.training`.
//
// Depends on: DayPredicate, SignalEvaluator, FoodLogCore (DaySignals,
// FoodTag), AchievementDefinition.
// Depended on by: BossPicker, BossFight, WeeklyBossFeature, the app's boss
// screens (names, symbols, lines).
