# czech-food-catalog Specification

## Purpose
Search a second, legitimately-licensed food database (Open Food Facts) with genuine Czech product coverage, displayed clearly separate from Garmin's own catalog, without ever scraping or reproducing any proprietary Czech nutrition database.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Czech-database search results are drawn from Open Food Facts

The system SHALL search Open Food Facts's free-text search endpoint for a given term and SHALL NOT source this data from any proprietary third-party Czech nutrition database.

#### Scenario: Searching for a Czech product

- **WHEN** the user searches for a food by name
- **THEN** results from Open Food Facts are retrieved via its confirmed free-text search endpoint

#### Scenario: A Czech-specific filter is available

- **WHEN** the user searches with the Czech country filter enabled
- **THEN** only products tagged as available in the Czech Republic are returned

### Requirement: Czech-database results are visibly distinct from Garmin results

The system SHALL display Open Food Facts results in a section clearly separate from and labeled apart from Garmin's own search results, so the user always knows which database a given result came from.

#### Scenario: Both sources have results for the same search term

- **WHEN** a search term returns results from both Garmin and Open Food Facts
- **THEN** the two result sets are shown in visibly distinct, separately labeled sections, not merged into one list

### Requirement: Czech-database nutrition values are mapped to the app's existing food model

The system SHALL decode Open Food Facts's per-100g nutrition fields into the same `Food`/`Serving` shape used for Garmin results, so the rest of the logging flow treats a Czech-database food identically once selected.

#### Scenario: Decoding a real Open Food Facts response

- **WHEN** an Open Food Facts search result includes per-100g calorie, protein, carbohydrate, and fat values
- **THEN** they are mapped into the app's standard serving macro fields without loss

### Requirement: Czech product names are used when Open Food Facts has them

The system SHALL request and prefer Open Food Facts' Czech name fields when
searching and displaying Czech products:

1. `product_name_cs`
2. `generic_name_cs`
3. `product_name`, as the fallback

The system SHALL use Search-a-licious (`search.openfoodfacts.org`, to be
probed and recorded before use), falling back to `cgi/search.pl` when it is
unavailable.

#### Scenario: Czech-only name field

- **WHEN** a product's `product_name` is English but `product_name_cs` is "Kefírové mléko"
- **THEN** the result displays "Kefírové mléko" and matches the query "kefir"

#### Scenario: Primary endpoint down

- **WHEN** Search-a-licious returns an error
- **THEN** the same query is answered from `cgi/search.pl` and results still appear
