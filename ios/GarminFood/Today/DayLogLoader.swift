// DayLogLoader.swift
//
// Loads any day for the Today tab and turns it into a `DayDashboard`
// (meal-dashboard spec). Replaces `TodaySummaryLoader`, which read today
// only and kept nothing but the calorie total.
//
// Garmin data per date is kept in memory, so a failed refresh keeps showing
// the last good copy (marked stale) instead of blanking the day. Queued
// entries come from the outbox on every rebuild, so a log appears in its
// meal immediately, before any network call.
//
// Also carries the selected day's active calories (`activeKilocalories`,
// fix-testing-feedback-quick-wins) for the summary card's informational
// "Active today" line -- one extra read per refresh, run concurrently with
// the food log and silently dropped on failure.
//
// add-standalone-mode 2.5: in standalone mode `reader` answers from the
// local food log, deletes go to the local coordinator, and `rebuild()`
// re-reads the (local, file-backed) day so a confirm shows immediately.
// The per-date caches are dropped whenever the data mode changes (the
// Diagnostics testing toggle), so one source's rows never show, or get
// edited/deleted, under the other.
//
// improve-food-day-flow (E2): deleting a synced entry no longer waits for
// Garmin. The coordinator queues the delete; `rebuild()` hands the queued
// deletes to `MealDashboard.build`, which marks the row "Deleting…" and
// takes its share off the totals; and every successful read of a day tells
// the queue which confirmed deletes that read no longer lists
// (`Outbox.pruneConfirmedDeletions`).
