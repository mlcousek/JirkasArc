// MealDashboard.swift
//
// The Today screen's data, organised the way Garmin Connect's food page is:
// meal by meal, each with its foods and consumed-vs-suggested calories and
// macros (add-app-shell-and-meal-dashboard, meal-dashboard spec, design D2).
//
// Pure: a `DailyFoodLog` (GET /nutrition-service/food/logs/{date}, 200 on
// 2026-09-16), the outbox's queued entries and the locally cached foods in,
// a `DayDashboard` out. Everything a test can check lives here; the app
// target only loads the inputs and draws the result.
//
// Evidence behind the rules (probed 2026-09-16):
// - every `mealDetails[]` item carries `mealNutritionGoals`, including
//   `adjusted*` variants that add burned calories on top of the plan
//   (deliberately NOT used as the target since 2026-09-23 -- see `target`);
// - a meal with nothing logged returns an EMPTY `mealNutritionContent`;
// - `meal.startTime`/`endTime` exist for breakfast, lunch and dinner, and
//   not for snacks.
//
// improve-food-day-flow (E2): the day also takes the queued DELETES of
// synced entries (GarminKit `FoodLogDeletion`). A delete that is waiting
// keeps its row, marked `MealEntry.deletion == .deleting`, with its share
// taken off the meal's and the day's totals; one Garmin confirmed hides the
// row (until the day is read again without it); one that gave up marks the
// row `.failed` and counts it again -- the entry really is still in Garmin.
