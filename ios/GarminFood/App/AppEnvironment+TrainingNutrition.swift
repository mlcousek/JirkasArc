// AppEnvironment+TrainingNutrition.swift
//
// add-winter-arc-nutrition-and-rewards: where the training plan reaches the
// food and reward sides -- ONLY in the training experience. Food-first (and
// standalone, which is always food-first) gets `nil` / `false` / `[]` from
// every accessor here, so nothing it shows or judges changes.
//
//   - `wireTrainingNutrition()` (end of AppEnvironment.init): the providers
//     GamificationEngine (goal status by the carb band) and FeatureHost
//     (training experience on, reward facts, paused fasting days) read;
//   - `trainingFuelTarget(for:)`: the Today summary's plan-day targets;
//     the weight fallback is the latest weigh-in when the plan has no
//     `athlete.weightKg`;
//   - `isFastingPausedByPlan(on:)` / `fastingPausedDaysByPlan(now:)`: the
//     fasting surfaces (home card note, confirm-screen note, history,
//     reminders) -- the owner's fasting settings are never changed, the
//     plan only pauses the judgement and the nags for its "off" days.
//
// The adapters themselves are TrainingNutritionBridge.swift.
//
// add-training-gamification-and-150-levels D6, D10: it also wires the plan's
// facts for the training XP into FeatureHost (TrainingPlanSignalsBridge,
// with the plan file's extra fields read from the cached bytes), and runs
// the gamification features right after a training event is recorded, so a
// check-in's XP shows at once.
//
// Depends on: AppEnvironment, TrainingModel (+TrainingNutritionBridge),
// WeightLoader. Depended on by: AppEnvironment.init/syncNotifications,
// TodayView, the fasting views.
