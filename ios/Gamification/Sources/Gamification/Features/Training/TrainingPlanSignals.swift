// TrainingPlanSignals.swift
//
// add-training-gamification-and-150-levels (design D6): the training plan's
// facts as the training XP reads them -- plain strings, numbers and flags,
// so this package never imports TrainingCore (it depends only on
// FoodLogCore). The app's adapter (GarminFood/Training/
// TrainingPlanSignalsBridge.swift) copies TrainingCore's `TrainingPlanFacts`
// into this shape, field by field.
//
// These are FACTS, not judgements: a session says whether it is done and
// with which option, a day carries the morning light of a check-in. Whether
// that makes the session "within the light", the day "kept" or the week
// "kept within plan" is decided by `TrainingXPRules`, in this package, where
// every guard is tested with literal signals.
//
// `TrainingSignals` (add-winter-arc-nutrition-and-rewards) stays as it is,
// beside this: it is what the five original badge ladders were built on,
// and an app that passes only it keeps working.
//
// Days are `yyyy-MM-dd` and weeks `YYYY-Www`, the strings both sides already
// use, so they double as reward keys and store ids. The light's cases avoid
// colour words (`greenLight`, not `green`) for the same reason TrainingCore's
// do: the app's design-token lint forbids `.green` / `.red` literals in
// views and adapters.
//
// Depended on by: FeatureContext, TrainingXPRules, TrainingRewardsFeature,
// the training variants of boss, bingo and journeys. Tests:
// TrainingXPRulesTests.
