// NotificationScheduler.swift
//
// Owns every `UNUserNotificationCenter` call. `FoodLogCore.NotificationPlanning.
// plan(...)` decides WHAT should be scheduled right now (pure, testable);
// this type is the side-effecting half that actually asks for permission and
// syncs the system's pending requests to match.
//
// fix-review-findings-2026-09 (findings 10, 11): the dated requests below
// now cover a rolling window of days (`NotificationPlanning.planWindow`,
// training via `TrainingReminderPlanner.plan(days:)`), not today only, so
// they keep firing while the app stays closed; and granting the permission
// prompt re-runs the sync (`AppEnvironment.requestNotificationPermission
// IfNeeded`).
//
// Local notifications can't dynamically ask "has this already happened" at
// fire time -- there is no Notification Service Extension hook for LOCAL
// notifications (only remote/push ones), and this project has no push
// capability anyway (free-tier constraint). So instead of one long-lived
// repeating request per reminder, each planned notification becomes a
// SINGLE, date-scoped request for TODAY only (identifier
// "<kind>.<yyyy-MM-dd>"). `sync(...)` is called on every foreground, right
// after logging something, and after a notification setting changes -- it
// re-plans from current state and diffs against what's actually pending:
// anything no longer planned (already logged, disabled, or a stale date) is
// removed, anything newly planned and not yet pending is added, and anything
// pending whose title/body differs from the plan (e.g. scheduled before a
// language switch -- add-localization 3.3b) is re-added with the current
// text. The diff itself is `NotificationPlanning.diff` (FoodLogCore, unit
// tested). This is the
// same "replan and reconcile" shape `Reconciliation`/`Outbox` already use
// for Garmin delivery, applied to local notifications instead.
//
// `syncFastingReminders(...)` is a second, independent replan-and-diff
// cycle for the "fast ends soon" / "fast starts soon" reminders
// (redesign-fasting-schedule 2.5). Kept separate from `sync(...)` because
// these are REPEATING daily requests anchored to the fixed daily fasting
// window, not today-only ones (see `NotificationPlanning.
// PlannedFastingReminder`'s header for why that exception to design D2 is
// safe here): they have no "skip it today" condition, so a repeating
// trigger keeps them firing even on days the app isn't opened.
