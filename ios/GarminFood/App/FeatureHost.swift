// FeatureHost.swift
//
// add-gamification-signals D7: the app-side runner of the gamification
// plug-in seam. It (1) builds the `SignalsSnapshot` every feature reads --
// from LOCAL stores only (usage history, food cache, cached Garmin day-log
// digests, activity cache, provenance, water, the Garmin health cache, day
// notes, fasting, goal status) via FoodLogCore's pure `DaySignalsBuilder`,
// never the network -- and (2) runs every registered `GamificationFeature`
// and applies what it returns: XP/freeze grants through the idempotent
// `RewardLedger`, badge unlocks through the existing `AchievementStore`
// (+ `XPAward.achievementBonus`, exactly like core achievements), and
// moments into `GamificationEngine.pendingMoments`.
//
// Called by `GamificationEngine.refresh` and at the end of
// `handleLogConfirmed` -- i.e. after the entry is already committed to the
// outbox, off the confirm action's critical path, with no network await.
//
// A misbehaving feature is contained: a grant outside its own
// `<featureId>.` key namespace or a badge id it doesn't declare is dropped
// and logged to `DiagnosticsLog` (category "features"), a failed ledger/
// store write is logged, and the other features still run. (`update` is
// non-throwing by protocol, so there is no error to catch from it.)
//
// Secret badges get NO generic `.achievementUnlocked` moment: their feature
// supplies its own `.secret` reveal, so a secret title is never shown twice
// or before the reveal (design D7).
//
// Depends on: Gamification (seam, registry, ledger, badges), FoodLogCore
// (stores, DaySignalsBuilder), GarminKit (DiagnosticsLog), AppPreferences,
// GamificationSignalsSync (cached first name).
//
// add-standalone-mode 7.1 (D11): in standalone mode the snapshot is built
// from `SignalsInput.standalone` -- no activities, active kcal or Garmin
// water/weigh-ins even if their caches still hold Garmin-era data, weigh-ins
// from this phone -- so nothing needing activities is ever offered, and
// `visibleBadgeCatalog` hides Garmin-only badges not yet earned
// (`StandaloneAvailability`).
//
// add-supplements D9: also builds the supplement digest
// (`buildSupplementSignals`, FoodLogCore's pure `SupplementSignalsBuilder`
// over the supplement stores) that GamificationEngine passes to the shared
// freeze planner and into `FeatureContext.supplements`; an optional
// source's badge bonus is scaled by `XPBudget.optionalGrantXP`.
//
// add-winter-arc-nutrition-and-rewards: three providers AppEnvironment sets
// from the training plan (TrainingNutritionBridge) -- whether the training
// experience is on, the plan's reward facts and the days the plan paused
// fasting. They go into `FeatureContext` (features keep quiet what pushes
// against the plan, the training feature rewards what supports it), the
// fasting days of the snapshot (a paused day is neutral) and the visible
// badges (TrainingExperienceAvailability).
//
// add-training-gamification-and-150-levels D6: a fourth provider, the
// plan's facts for the training XP (`trainingPlanSignalsProvider`, async
// because it reads the cached plan file's extra fields), goes into
// `FeatureContext.trainingPlan`. The training rewards are a budgeted XP
// line now, no longer an optional source: their grants and badge bonuses
// are paid in full.
// Depended on by: GamificationEngine; Progress/Today slot views (via
// `feature(_:)` and `summaries`).
