// LocalLogEntryCoordinator.swift
//
// Standalone mode's implementation of every food-log write
// (add-standalone-mode D4, task 2.2): the same `FoodLogging` surface as the
// Garmin `LogEntryCoordinator`, but committing to `LocalFoodLogStore` -- the
// system of record for an install with no Garmin account. There is no
// outbox, no drain and no "syncing" state: the local write IS the durable
// write, so every confirm returns as soon as one JSON file is replaced, and
// nothing here touches the network (the zero-network-wait rule holds
// structurally, as it does for the outbox).
//
// What must match Garmin mode exactly -- the bookkeeping other features
// read regardless of mode, so quick picks, remembered servings, streaks,
// XP and "Log again" behave the same:
//   - usage history: recorded on confirm, custom-food confirm, every preset
//     ingredient, duplicate and copy; NOT on edit (an edit isn't another
//     thing eaten). Same ids: a custom food under its own UUID and
//     `CustomFoodDraft.servingId`.
//   - serving defaults: set on catalog confirm (incl. preset catalog
//     ingredients) and on edit; not on custom-food confirm or duplicate.
//   - food cache: `FoodCacheStore.cacheForDisplay`, the one shared rule, on
//     edit, duplicate and copy.
// `LocalLogEntryCoordinatorTests` runs both coordinators side by side and
// compares the three stores.
//
// What deliberately differs:
//   - Nutrients are snapshotted at confirm (serving x quantity); a custom
//     food logs its OWN macros, never a backing Garmin food's (it has no
//     Garmin to log to). The discrepancy note is therefore empty.
//   - An edit changes the entry in place (amount rescaled by the quantity
//     ratio, meal moved), instead of Garmin's create-then-delete replace.
//   - A preset or a copy is ONE atomic write of all its entries, not N
//     separate commits: the local store can offer that, so a failure can't
//     leave half a meal logged.
//   - wave 3 (design D5): a catalog serving with no calorie value is
//     refused (`StandaloneLoggingError.caloriesUnknown`, see
//     NutritionCompleteness.swift) -- an Open Food Facts product is logged as
//     itself here, with no Garmin match step to catch it. And a logged Open
//     Food Facts / offline-index product is put in the food cache: in Garmin
//     mode a Garmin food is already there from search (FoodSearchEngine's
//     back-fill), but nothing else caches an OFF product, and without it
//     Quick pick, "Log again" and her own-foods search couldn't show it.
//     Garmin/FatSecret foods are left alone, so the parity with Garmin mode
//     above still holds for them.
//   - The `OutboxEntry` values returned are receipts only (the protocol is
//     `LogEntryCoordinator`'s exact shape, design D4, and no caller reads
//     more than "it didn't throw"): `id` is the local entry's id, `state`
//     `.sent` because it is already in the system of record. They are never
//     enqueued anywhere.
//
// Local entries reach the dashboard as `MealEntry.Status.synced(logId:)`
// with `logId == entry.id.uuidString` (`LocalNutritionReader`): "synced"
// already means "present in the system of record" (design D4), which is
// how `edit`/`duplicate`/`deleteCommitted` find them again.
//
// Depends on: LocalFoodLogStore, UsageHistoryStore, ServingDefaultStore,
// FoodCacheStore. Depended on by: ModeRoutingFoodLogging (AppServices).
