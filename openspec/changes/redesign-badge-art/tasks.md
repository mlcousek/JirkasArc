Every wave ends with CI green. All art is hand-written SVG in the subset of
design D3. No app drawing code changes before task 2.4 is ticked by the
owner. Relative size: S / M / L.

## 0. Owner decisions

Each has a default; unanswered ones are built as the default.

- [x] 0.1 Style: sticker (outlined, cel-shaded; default) or the flatter modern variant (design D1). *Owner 2026-10-01: sticker.*
- [x] 0.2 A locked badge shows its family shape in grey (default) or stays a plain grey disc (D5). *Owner 2026-10-01: the family shape.*
- [x] 0.3 Any badge with its own one-off picture in the first release (default: none). *Owner 2026-10-01: none.*

## 1. Wave 1 - style sample (M)

- [x] 1.1 `ios/BadgeArt/` sources: the 13 frame shapes, the five rarity trims, and 10 motifs (flame, fork and knife, plate, scale, water drop, moon, star, crown, capsule, question mark). *Done 2026-10-01: shapes are hand-written path data in `tools/docs/write-badge-art.mjs`, which writes the committed SVG files (all 13 x 5 frames already, 92 KB). Epic's trim became ribbon tails: the wings read as noise at 44 pt.*
- [x] 1.2 `tools/docs/lint-badge-svg.mjs`: the allowed subset, a 24 x 24 motif view box and 64 x 64 frame view box, total size; wired into `.github/workflows/build.yml`'s localization job (no macOS needed).
- [x] 1.3 `tools/docs/build-badge-gallery.mjs` -> `docs/guide/badges.html`: the sample at 44, 60 and 120 pt, locked and unlocked, light and dark, both style variants side by side. *The modern variant is the same files with the outline removed.*
- [x] 1.4 Owner looks at the gallery and answers 0.1 to 0.3; record the answers in design.md.

## 2. Wave 2 - the full set and the catalog (L)

- [x] 2.1 `ios/Gamification/Sources/Gamification/BadgeArtCatalog.swift`: badge -> (family, motif); header comment per house style. *Family from the id's namespace, else the category; motif from the badge's existing `badgeSymbol` (94 symbols -> 51 motifs), so there is no per-badge table (design D4, updated).*
- [x] 2.2 Tests (`BadgeArtCatalogTests`; first compiled in CI): every badge id from every badge source (core, secrets, bingo, boss, journeys, records, collections, seasonal, sport and body, supplements, training, level tiers) resolves; no unknown family or motif name.
- [x] 2.3 The remaining frames (13 shapes x 5 rarities) and motifs; `tools/docs/check-badge-art.mjs` fails when the catalog and the files disagree, in CI. *65 frames + 51 motifs, 120 KB.*
- [x] 2.4 The gallery shows all badges with a family filter; **owner approves it** (the gate for wave 3). *Approved by the owner 2026-10-01.* *Gallery built 2026-10-01 (257 badges incl. level tiers; the training badges are missing from the guide's data and are covered by the Swift test only). Waiting for the owner.*

## 3. Wave 3 - the app (M)

- [x] 3.1 Imagesets in `Assets.xcassets` generated from the sources by a script (vector preserved, original rendering); the script is re-runnable and its output is committed. *`tools/docs/build-badge-assets.mjs`, 116 imagesets under `Assets.xcassets/BadgeArt`; `--check` runs in CI.*
- [ ] 3.2 One family only (streak) in `BadgeMedallion`: frame + motif, the locked silhouette, the fallback to the disc; the other families still use the disc. Sideload and compare with the gallery at 40, 60 and 120 pt. Record what differed. *Code done 2026-10-01 (`BadgeArt.enabledFamilies = [.streak]`; every call site already passes its family; the streak-milestone celebration uses it too). Waiting for the owner's sideload.*
- [x] 3.3 All families; the 11 call sites pass the badge (or its family and motif); the secret question-mark frame; the existing shine kept for epic and legendary. *2026-10-09: `BadgeArt.enabledFamilies = Set(BadgeFamily.allCases)`; every call site passes its family (Achievements grid and detail, level tiers, seasonal, sport and body, supplements, the moments); the achievement-unlocked moment now carries the badge's family (`GamificationMoment.achievementUnlocked(..., family:)`), so it shows the drawn art too; the challenge moments use the bingo frame. A hidden secret is the secrets silhouette with a question mark; the shine is masked to the frame. Only the previews and the `.feature` moments keep the disc. Device check under 3.2/4.2.*
- [ ] 3.4 Accessibility: labels name the rarity; Differentiate Without Colour and the largest Dynamic Type checked on the Achievements grid. *Code done 2026-10-09: the Achievements grid already read "title, rarity achievement"; the seasonal, sport and body and supplement tiles now do too ("%@, %@ badge", "%@, %@ badge, earned", "%@, %@ badge, not earned yet. %@", EN + CS). The frame shape (family) and the trim carry the rarity besides colour. Waiting for the owner: Differentiate Without Colour and the largest Dynamic Type on a device.*
- [x] 3.5 `BadgeMedallion.swift`'s header rewritten (the "no image assets" reasoning no longer holds); `docs/guide/` links the gallery. *The header describes the drawn art and the disc fallback; the guide's badge note links `badges.html` and no longer calls the in-app art SF Symbols; `docs/guide/README.md` names the gallery and its build script.*

## 4. Verification

- [ ] 4.1 CI green; `openspec validate redesign-badge-art --strict` passes.
- [ ] 4.2 On device: Achievements grid and detail, the unlock moment, level tiers, sport and body, seasonal, supplements; light and dark; every theme. No empty or misdrawn badge.
- [ ] 4.3 App size before and after noted here (budget: under 400 KB added).
