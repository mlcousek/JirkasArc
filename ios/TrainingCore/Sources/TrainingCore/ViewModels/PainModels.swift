// PainModels.swift
//
// The morning pain step and the pain shown on Today and in Plan
// (add-checkin-pain-score design D5, D6), as pure models:
//
//   - `PainDraft`: the rows the owner is editing -- one per site, a score
//     0-10 in half steps, a short note for "other". It does the rounding,
//     the add/remove rules, the default sites and the `pains` payload, so
//     the app's view only draws it and holds it as state.
//   - `PainStepModel`: the step under the check-in row, non-nil once the
//     day has a chosen light (`CheckInRowModel.pain`). Open while the day's
//     pain is not asked yet; else folded to "Edit pain". Its draft starts
//     from the recorded answer, or from the default sites at 0 -- the
//     Achilles sites of the latest earlier day that scored one, else the
//     left Achilles -- so one tap on Save confirms "0". Save builds the
//     same check-in as the row (date, light, session, option) plus `pains`,
//     which replaces the day's answer (the vault's rule, CheckInOverlay).
//   - `TrainingFormatting.painLine` ("Pain: Achilles (left) 4.5/10 ·
//     Knee (right) 1/10", or "Pain: none") for Today's card, and
//     `painTags` for the Plan day rows.
//
// add-daily-checkin-and-pain-mode: the step opens by itself only in pain
// mode (`PainStepModel.isPainMode`, from `TrainingSnapshot.painMode`).
// Otherwise it is one small "Something hurts?" link under the lights
// (`somethingHurtsTitle`) that opens the same editor; saving a score above
// 0 there turns the phone's half of pain mode on (PainModeState). The
// pain line and the pain tags are built only in pain mode by their
// builders. The step no longer needs a plan: a day skeleton has `pains`
// too.
//
// The phone never computes the pain flags: `pain-rising` / `pain-high`
// come from the vault as week rule notes. Nothing here is about anyone in
// particular: the defaults come from what was recorded.
//
// Depended on by: CheckInModels (the row), TodayTrainingModel (painLine),
// PlanModels (painTags), the app's CheckInRowView. Tests: PainTests.
