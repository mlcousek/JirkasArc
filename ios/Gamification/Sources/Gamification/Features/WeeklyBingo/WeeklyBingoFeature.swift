// WeeklyBingoFeature.swift
//
// add-weekly-bingo: the "bingo" gamification feature -- a 3x3 card per
// ISO week (free centre + 8 tasks from BingoTaskCatalog), squares that tick
// themselves from the week's day signals, 25 XP per completed line and
// 150 XP + a streak-freeze grant for a full card. Replaces the empty stub
// registered by add-gamification-signals (design D7);
// `GamificationFeatureRegistry` still creates it with `init(directory:)`.
//
// Each run (FeatureHost, after every refresh/confirm; local reads only):
//   1. week = ISO week of the snapshot's logged-date "today";
//   2. loads this week's card, or generates it ONCE (BingoCardGenerator,
//      eligibility from the last 14 days, last week's card excluded) and
//      stores it -- it never changes again that week;
//   3. merges fresh completions into the stored, sticky ones
//      (BingoEvaluator; only this week's days count);
//   4. grants `bingo.line.<week>.<line>` per complete line and
//      `bingo.full.<week>` + `bingo.freeze.<week>` for a full card -- every
//      run, because `RewardLedger` makes them idempotent. The freeze is a
//      plain `.streakFreeze` grant: the ledger records it
//      (`RewardLedger.freezeGrants()`), and the streak-freeze change turns
//      recorded grants into a balance -- nothing freeze-specific lives here;
//   5. emits a moment and bumps the lifetime counters only the first time
//      a line / the full card is recorded on the card, then requests the
//      badges (D6) the counters and stored cards justify.
//
// The previous week's card is no longer evaluated from Monday on -- it is
// frozen as-is and stays in the 12-week history -- except for its whole-day
// squares (`BingoTask.judgesCompletedDaysOnly`: today never ticks them, so
// its Sunday can only be judged once the week is over).
//
// add-training-gamification-and-150-levels D9: in the training experience,
// with a plan that has written days, a NEW card also draws from the eight
// training squares (`BingoTaskCatalog.training`), and those squares are
// judged from `context.trainingPlan` -- once more on the Monday after,
// together with the whole-day squares.
//
// Depends on: GamificationFeature, BingoTaskCatalog, BingoCardGenerator,
// BingoEvaluator, BingoStore, XPAward+Features, FoodLogCore.
// Depended on by: GamificationFeatureRegistry, the app's BingoSlotView /
// BingoCardView.
