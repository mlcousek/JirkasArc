// ChallengeTemplates+Supplements.swift
//
// add-supplements D9, task 6.3: four long-running challenges about the
// supplement stack, appended to `ChallengeCatalog.all` and evaluated from
// the supplement digest (`ChallengeKind.supplementDays`,
// `ChallengeEngine.progress(... supplements:)`).
//
// They are in the rotation ONLY while the feature is enabled with at least
// one product (`ChallengeRotationPolicy.supplements` active), and a
// slot-time rule only once that slot was completed at least once in the
// last 14 days (the same "data must exist" rule every signal template
// follows). Their static weight is 0: they are not part of "complete every
// challenge" (an optional feature can't be required for a core badge) and
// don't move the rotation-weighted mean reward XPBudget assumes. Their XP
// is ordinary challenge XP: the one challenge slot pays about the same
// whichever template fills it, so offering these doesn't add XP per day.
//
// Ids are persisted (ChallengeStore / ChallengeHistoryStore) -- never
// rename one. Text: English here, Czech per id in cs.lproj/Catalog.strings
// (CatalogL10n; these kinds are not `isSignalBased`).
//
// Depends on: ChallengeTemplate/ChallengeKind, CatalogL10n, FoodLogCore
// (SupplementSignals). Depended on by: ChallengeCatalog.all,
// ChallengeEngine, ChallengeRotationPolicy.
