// The app's entry point. Task 6.1 (add-garmin-auth-and-sync) originally
// used this file only to prove `xcodebuild` could build something in CI at
// all; the real UI (food catalog, custom foods, confirm-and-log flow) now
// lives under GarminFood/{App,DesignSystem,Catalog,CustomFood,LogEntry}/,
// composed from `ContentView` -- see that file and `App/AppEnvironment.swift`.

        // a Control finds it. (Touches no store until a Control fires.)
