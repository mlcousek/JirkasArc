// Pain.swift
//
// The morning pain score (add-checkin-pain-score design D1, D2, D4): the
// vault's contract added `pains` to `checkin.morning` and to every
// projection day on 2026-09-30 (its decision A57), additively within v1.
//
//   pains: [ { site, score, note? } ] | null
//     site   achilles-left | achilles-right | knee-left | knee-right | other
//            (any other string reads as `other`, never an error)
//     score  0-10 in steps of 0.5 (0 is an answer, not "unknown")
//     note   1-200 characters
//
// `nil` means "not asked", `[]` "asked, nothing hurts"; a site missing from
// the list is unknown, never 0. One type serves both directions: the
// projection's `day.pains` (decoded tolerantly, like every field) and the
// app's own `checkin.morning` (HubEvent.swift writes it, the only file that
// knows the event wire format).
//
// add-daily-checkin-and-pain-mode: `PainMode` is `athlete.painMode`, the
// vault's switch for every pain feature (below).
//
// add-training-gates-and-load: `SessionPainEntry` is the pain during and
// after a session (`session.rpe.pains`, `session.feedback.pains`).
//
// Depended on by: HubEvent (MorningCheckInPayload.pains), Projection (Day),
// CheckInOverlay, PainModels. Tests: PainTests, HubEventTests,
// ProjectionDecodingTests.
