# Projection contract fixtures (mirrored)

- **Contract:** `hub.projection`, schema version **1** (final v1).
- **Source:** the vault's `add-training-plan-model` change, which generates
  both files from a synthetic 2030/31 season (no real names, races, zones
  or activities) and checks them byte for byte on its side.
- **Copied:** 2026-09-29, verbatim (byte for byte, LF line endings; see
  `.gitattributes`). Re-mirrored the same day after the vault's
  `add-garmin-workout-push` (additive, still v1): `option.watch` is filled
  (`name`, `state` pending/scheduled/failed, `channel`, `ref`, `at`),
  `done.source` gains `"activity-name"`, every workout has `watchName`.
  Re-mirrored 2026-09-29 from the vault's main branch after its
  `add-hub-ingest` merged (additive, still v1): `day.light` filled with
  `day.lightSource` (`checkin` | `option`), `session.feedback`
  `{ rpe, feel, note }`, week `ruleNotes`, rule edits (`origin` with
  `kind: moved|swapped|rule`, options cut to R, `status: "skipped"`), and
  top-level `acks`, `outcomes`, `rejected` filled from the event log.
  Re-mirrored again the same day (vault main `13c0d987`): the vault now
  refuses moving, swapping or skipping a race session, so the race stays
  on Sun 3 Nov and the command's outcome is `refused` with a bilingual
  reason; the second device's applied move now moves the W43 Sunday walk
  (`2030-w43-sun-pm`) to Fri 25 Oct.
  Re-mirrored 2026-09-30 from the vault's main branch after its morning
  pain score (decision A57; additive, still v1): every day has `pains`
  (`null` = not asked; 2030-10-23 has `achilles-left` 5.5 with a note and
  `knee-right` 1), W43 gains a `pain-high` rule note, and the phone's ack
  is `seq` 24. The minimal projection is unchanged. All four files were
  copied again and checked for anything non-synthetic first (no names,
  repositories, tokens or real dates: season 2030/31 only).
  Re-mirrored 2026-10-01 from the vault's main branch after its daily
  check-in context (2026-09-30, `schemaVersion` still 1), for this app's
  `add-daily-checkin-and-pain-mode`. Both projection files changed, the
  two event files did not (compared by blob hash, left as they were):
  - top-level `days` -- **day skeletons** for every window date no written
    week holds, the same `Day` shape with `sessions: []`. The example has
    14 (2030-11-04 ... 2030-11-17, the unwritten W45-W46); the minimal
    file has all 42 window dates (2030-10-07 ... 2030-11-17), because it
    has no plan. A date is looked up in `plan.weeks[].days`, else in
    `days`;
  - `athlete.painMode` `{ active, since, sites, reason, clearsAfter }`:
    active in the example (since 2030-10-14, `reason: "light"`, sites
    `achilles-left` and `knee-right`), inactive in the minimal file;
  - `day.fuel` on EVERY day (it was `null` outside carb-load days -- the
    one change that is not purely additive): `kind: "daily"` with
    `carbsGPerKg: { min, max }`, or `kind: "carb-load"` with the number,
    `carbsG` and `raceId` as before; plus `proteinGPerKg`, `fasting`
    (`allowed` | `off`) with `fastingReasons`, `load` (all five values
    appear), `plannedMin` and `rules`. A carb-load day is
    `kind == "carb-load"`, never "fuel is not null".
  Checked again for anything non-synthetic before committing (no names,
  repositories, tokens, addresses or real dates).
  Re-mirrored again 2026-10-01, later the same day, from the vault's main
  branch after its training load and gates (2026-10-01, all additive,
  `schemaVersion` still 1). Both projection files and the event example
  changed; the minimal event file did not (all four compared by blob hash
  with the vault's). What is new in the projection -- this app decodes
  none of it yet (unknown keys are ignored, new enumeration values read as
  unknown), it only has to keep reading the files:
  - `athlete.gate` (the weekly gate test; `null` in the minimal file);
  - seven load fields on every non-null `week.actual` (`plannedRunKm`,
    `unplannedRunKm`, `overPlanKm`, `longestRunKm`, `longestRunCapKm`,
    `hillM`, `highSessions`) and `flag` on every `unplanned` entry;
  - `done.manual` on every `done`, and `done.source: "manual"` /
    `matchedBy: "manual"` for a session ticked done without a watch: the
    W43 gym session `2030-w43-mon-pm` is now `done` with no activity;
  - `feedback.pains` on every `feedback`, and a `session-pain` rule note on
    the W43 tempo -- a note only, never an edit (`PlanEditPolicy`
    `noteOnlyRules`);
  - top-level `notices` (`[]` in the example, one `no-activities-since` in
    the minimal file);
  - `streak`, `history` and `adherence` on every habit.
  What moved in the values the goldens read: W43 has one more session
  (`2030-w43-tue-pm`, mobility, missed) so its `targets.sessions` is 7 and
  `actual.sessionsDone` 2; Monday 21 Oct has `habitsDone` `holds: 2`,
  `gym: 1`; the habits' `window14` is 20 of 24 (83 %) and 3 of 3 (100 %);
  the phone's ack is `seq` 31; `outcomes` has 12 entries (two refused
  `habit.tick`, with `week` and `sessionId` `null`).
  Checked once more for anything non-synthetic (season 2030/31 only).

| File | What it is |
|---|---|
| `projection.v1.example.json` | Every field of v1: a season, four written weeks, 14 day skeletons, pain mode on, a `fuel` on every day, the gate test, a session done by hand. |
| `projection.v1.minimal.json` | No season and no plan (`season: null`, `plan: null`); 42 day skeletons, pain mode off, no gate test, one data-gap notice. |

Do not edit these files. When the vault changes its fixtures (additive
changes only within v1), copy them again verbatim, update the date above and
re-run `swift test` (ProjectionDecodingTests, TodayBuilderTests,
PlanBuilderTests, DailyCheckInTests). App-authored edge cases are mutations of the example made
in the tests (`Fixtures.mutatedExample`), never hand-copied vault data.

# Event contract fixtures (mirrored)

- **Contract:** the event log v1 (envelope `v: 1`) -- what the app writes
  into `events/<deviceId>/` (`add-training-checkins` design D2).
- **Source:** the vault's `add-hub-ingest` change (its contract's "Event
  log v1" section and its executable validator), generated synthetic:
  devices `ios-0a1b2c3d` and `ios-00000001`, season 2030, no real names or
  data.
- **Copied:** 2026-09-29, verbatim (byte for byte, LF; see
  `.gitattributes`), first from the change in progress and then again
  from the vault's main branch after it merged (both event files were
  identical). Re-mirror whenever the vault records a change in its fixture
  changelog. Re-mirrored 2026-09-30 for the morning pain score
  (add-checkin-pain-score): the example gained seq 24; the minimal file is
  unchanged. Re-mirrored 2026-10-01 for the vault's training load and
  gates (add-daily-checkin-and-pain-mode): the example grew from 24 to 31
  lines, no existing line changed -- seq 25 `test.gate`, 26 and 27
  `session.done`, 28 a `session.rpe` with `pains` (during / after), 29 a
  back-filled `habit.tick`, 30 and 31 two `habit.tick` the vault refuses
  (22 days back, a future day). The minimal file is unchanged.

| File | What it is |
|---|---|
| `events.v1.example.jsonl` | 31 events of every v1 type, including the plan commands (seq 16 a refused race move, seq 23 a superseded move) and `event.retracted`, which this app writes since add-plan-editing, `device.hello`, which it doesn't write yet, (seq 24, 2026-09-30) a second check-in of 2030-10-23 with `pains`, and (seq 25-31, 2026-10-01) `test.gate` and `session.done`, which this app doesn't write yet, an RPE with `pains` and three more habit ticks. |
| `events.v1.minimal.jsonl` | 3 events with every optional key omitted. |

`HubEventTests` decodes both: every type this app writes decodes to its
payload (`device.hello`, `test.gate` and `session.done` to `.other`; the
`pains` of an RPE is an ignored key), no line is invalid, and each
command and retraction line re-encodes to the same JSON object
(add-plan-editing). `PlanEditingTests` folds the example's commands with
the example projection's `acks` and `outcomes`. The app's
own byte-exact golden files are `../../Events/events.v1.app.jsonl` (every
check-in now carries `"pains":null`), `plan-commands.v1.app.jsonl` and
`checkin-pains.v1.app.jsonl` (add-checkin-pain-score), which the vault's
validator (`validateEvent`) accepted on 2026-09-29 and 2026-09-30.
