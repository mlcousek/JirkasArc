// FuelDay.swift
//
// add-winter-arc-nutrition-and-rewards (A1): in the training experience the
// food target follows the training day. The plan (TrainingCore's
// `DayFuelTargets`, copied into `FuelDayTarget` by the app -- FoodLogCore
// never imports TrainingCore) says how many grams of carbohydrate the day
// wants (the vault's PM-FUEL-1 g/kg band x weight) and about how much
// protein. This file is the pure judgement over that:
//
//   - `FuelDaySummary`: what the Today summary leads with -- carbs against
//     the band (below / in / above), protein against its target -- and
//     whether to show the gentle under-fuelling note: only on TODAY, from
//     `underFuellingHour` (18:00) on, when carbs are under
//     `underFuellingFraction` (75 %) of the band's lower edge. Never a
//     warning colour; never on a past day (nothing can be done about it).
//   - `displayBand(_:target:)`: the calorie ring's colour step with "over"
//     softened -- on a day with training sessions or a carb band, eating
//     past the calorie target is never shown orange or red (it becomes the
//     neutral ring). Without a target the ring is exactly as before.
//   - `judge(content:goals:target:)`: goal status for gamification that
//     never punishes eating inside the band (GoalStatusEvaluator's
//     training-experience path): with a band, calories AND carbs are met
//     once carbs reach the band's lower edge (above the band is not a
//     miss); on a training day without a band, calories are met from 95 %
//     of the target up with no upper limit; protein is met from 90 % of the
//     plan's protein target ("about 1.6 g/kg").
//
// improve-food-day-flow (C3): a carb-load day names its race
// (`FuelDayTarget.raceName`, copied to the summary) and, when the day has a
// SINGLE carbohydrate target (the band's two ends are equal), is judged
// against it in two words -- `FuelTargetStatus.below` or `.reached` -- and
// never as "too much": on a carb-load day more is not a miss. A band keeps
// below / in / above.
//
// Pure, no SwiftUI. Depended on by: GoalStatusEvaluator, the app's Today
// summary (FuelSummaryCard) and GamificationEngine. Tests:
// WinterArcNutritionTests.
