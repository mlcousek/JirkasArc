// BingoTaskCatalog+Training.swift
//
// add-training-gamification-and-150-levels (design D9): the eight bingo
// squares of the training experience, and how they are judged. They join
// the pool a NEW card is drawn from only in that experience and only with
// the plan's facts (`WeeklyBingoFeature.cardForWeek`); `BingoTaskCatalog.all`
// stays the 35 food tasks, so food-first cards never see one. A card already
// running keeps its squares.
//
// Every square is about following the plan or writing it down: check-ins,
// full habit days, kept plan days (rest days count), both strength
// sessions, a rated session. None asks for more training than planned, and
// none asks for an amber or red morning.
//
// They are judged from `TrainingPlanSignals` (`TrainingBingoRule`,
// `BingoEvaluator.trainingCompletionDay`), not from the food snapshot: a
// square is done on the first day of the card's week on which its count is
// reached. "Kept" is TrainingXPRules' verdict, the one the XP uses. Every
// training square is judged once more when its week is over (the
// evaluator's whole-day pass on Monday), because the plan's facts can
// arrive late: a session matched after a sync, or a Sunday rest day, which
// is only kept once it is over.
//
// The fuelling squares of this experience are the existing carbohydrate and
// protein goal squares: their goal status is already judged by the day's
// fuel band there.
//
// Ids ("t-…") are persisted in cards and never reused.
//
// Depends on: BingoTask, TrainingPlanSignals, TrainingXPRules.
// Depended on by: BingoTaskCatalog.task(id:), BingoEvaluator,
// WeeklyBingoFeature. Tests: TrainingVariantsTests.
