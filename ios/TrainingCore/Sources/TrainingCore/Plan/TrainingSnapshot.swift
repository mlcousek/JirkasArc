// TrainingSnapshot.swift
//
// What every builder reads instead of the raw file (design D8), so later
// changes extend the screens instead of rewriting them:
//
//   - `EffectivePlan` = the selected phase's weeks (+) a `PendingOverlay`.
//     add-plan-editing fills it (PlanCommandOverlay.swift) with the
//     phone's plan commands: the unacknowledged ones are applied, so every
//     screen shows the moved, swapped or skipped session where the phone
//     put it, and the builders read each command's status and the vault's
//     outcome from `EffectivePlan.overlay`;
//   - `TrainingCapabilities` says what the app may record.
//     add-training-checkins turns on check-ins, habit ticks and session
//     ratings when the vault connection has a device id
//     (`.checkIns(enabled:)`); add-plan-editing adds plan edits
//     (`.recording(enabled:)`). The option cards keep opening the detail;
//     the check-in is its own row (that change's D6);
//   - `checkIns` is the phone's own recent events (CheckInOverlay):
//     `EffectivePlan` applies their lights to each day, and the builders
//     read ticks, RPE and notes from it (that change's D5); since
//     add-checkin-pain-score also each day's morning `pains` (kept or
//     replaced like the vault does, CheckInOverlay).
//
// add-daily-checkin-and-pain-mode: `skeletonDays` are the projection's
// top-level `days` (the window's dates outside every written week, with
// the phone's check-ins applied like a plan day), and `day(_:)` is THE
// lookup of a date -- the plan's week first, else a skeleton -- so the
// check-in, habit ticks, fuel and reminders work on every day, also when
// there is no plan. `painMode` is the vault's `athlete.painMode` or the
// phone's own unread pain answer (PainModeState).
//
// Lookups across the season live here too (a week's own phase by
// `phaseId`, outline rows of every phase, races), so the builders never
// walk the file themselves.
//
// Depended on by: every builder, the app's TrainingModel. Tests: through
// the builder tests.
