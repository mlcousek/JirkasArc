// SportBodyCatalog.swift
//
// add-sport-and-body-achievements design D2: the badge definitions the
// sport & body feature declares (and alone may unlock -- `FeatureHost`
// drops undeclared ids). Ids: `sport.*` for activity/race badges, `body.*`
// for weight and fasting. Every badge is `.featureEvaluated` with an
// explicit rarity (the table in design D2) and `featureId` =
// `SportAndBodyFeature.id` ("sportBody").
//
// Categories reuse the existing `AchievementCategory` cases (activity and
// weight badges under Goal Hitting, fasting under Streaks) rather than
// adding a new case, so the shared Achievements screen needs no edit.
//
// Tier thresholds live here next to their ids so the feature and the tests
// read one table. Display text is localized from this package's
// Resources/<lang>.lproj (keys = English source text).
//
// Depends on: AchievementDefinition. Depended on by: SportAndBodyFeature,
// BodyRules, the app's SportBodyView.
