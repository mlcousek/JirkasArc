// TrainingModel.swift
//
// The plan as Today and Plan read it (add-training-today-and-plan task 4.1,
// design D12): a thin `@MainActor @Observable` holder of TrainingCore's
// `TrainingSource` -- still fetching, not published, unreadable, or a
// loaded `TrainingSnapshot` with its freshness. Every rule (decoding, the
// last good copy, freshness, the training day, what each card shows) lives
// in TrainingCore and is tested there; this only gathers the inputs and
// hands out builders in the app's language.
//
// Inputs: the last good projection (`ProjectionStore`, decoded off the main
// actor, no network), the refused-file reason, and VaultKit's status (the
// last successful sync, a 404 on the file). A rejection is remembered
// across launches in UserDefaults while VaultKit still holds a refused
// ETag -- the store keeps it in memory only, and after a relaunch the same
// refused file answers 304, so without this the loud "Update Jirka's Arc"
// would vanish while the file is still too new.
//
// Rebuilt: at launch and every foreground (AppEnvironment), after each
// projection refresh and disconnect (VaultController.onProjectionRefresh),
// and on day change. Views re-run the builders on each render; they are
// cheap and pure.
//
// add-training-checkins: it also carries the phone's own events
// (TrainingEventsService's overlay) and what the app may record
// (`TrainingCapabilities.checkIns(enabled:)`: connection on and a device
// id) into the snapshot, turns taps into events (check-in, habit tick, RPE,
// note -- local, durable, never waiting for the network), and re-plans the
// training reminders after each change.
//
// add-plan-editing: it also carries the phone's plan commands
// (`PendingOverlay`, folded with the cached projection's `acks` and
// `outcomes`) into the snapshot, with `TrainingCapabilities.recording`
// turning plan edits on under the same guard, and turns Move, Swap, Skip,
// Undo the skip, Override the rule and Withdraw into commands built by
// TrainingCore's PlanEditPolicy (which refuses what the vault would
// refuse) and recorded like a check-in.
//
// add-checkin-pain-score: the pain step's Save records the row's check-in
// again with `pains` (`recordPain`), which replaces the day's answer; a
// light alone keeps it (TrainingCore's CheckInOverlay).
//
// add-interactive-habits: it hands out `HabitsBuilder` (streaks, history,
// the day controls) and turns a control's step into what TrainingCore's
// `HabitDosePolicy` says: the on/off tick through the same recorder, and
// -- for a multi-dose day that isn't complete -- a count kept on the phone
// (`habitDoses`, one preference value; the wire only carries on/off, A42).
//
// Owned by AppEnvironment (`environment.training`); read by the Today
// training cards, the Plan tab and the Habits screens.
