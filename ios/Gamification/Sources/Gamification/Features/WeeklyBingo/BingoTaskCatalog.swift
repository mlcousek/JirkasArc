// BingoTaskCatalog.swift
//
// add-weekly-bingo design D2 + D6: the 35-task pool bingo cards are drawn
// from (10 easy, 14 medium, 11 hard) and the seven bingo badges. Pure data;
// `BingoCardGenerator` picks from it, `BingoEvaluator` judges it.
//
// Adding a task later is one row here. Ids are persisted in cards and are
// never removed or reused (a card whose id vanished treats that square as
// FREE -- `BingoEvaluator`). Display text is localized at first use, like
// `AchievementCatalog`; nothing persisted contains it.
//
// Rules the shared vocabulary has no single case for are composed from
// existing cases (`.all`/`.any`) -- DayPredicate must not grow in wave 2.
//
// Depends on: BingoTask, DayPredicate, WeekPredicate, FoodLogCore.FoodTag,
// AchievementDefinition. Depended on by: BingoCardGenerator,
// BingoEvaluator, WeeklyBingoFeature, BingoTaskCatalogTests.
