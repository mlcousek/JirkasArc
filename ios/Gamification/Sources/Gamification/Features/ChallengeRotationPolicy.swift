// ChallengeRotationPolicy.swift
//
// Design D11: trim the challenge catalog by rotation WEIGHT, never by
// deletion. Before this, ~94 % of picks were number ladders ("log on 4
// days", "log on 5 days", ...). Now:
//   - the 13 hand-authored templates: weight 2;
//   - the 24 creative signal-based templates: weight 3;
//   - number ladders: two tiers per family on an explicit allowlist, weight 1
//     (a "medium" and a "hard" tier; 14 families -> 28 templates);
//   - every other ladder tier: weight 0 -- still in `ChallengeCatalog.all`
//     so an active one finishes normally and its history/badges keep working;
//   - any template whose `DataRequirement` is not met by at least one of the
//     last 14 days of signals: weight 0 for this pick (no water data -> no
//     Hydration Station).
// That makes creative templates ~57 % of picks, ladders ~22 %.
//
// "Complete every challenge" (`achv-challenges-all`) now counts only the
// templates with a static weight > 0 (`allChallengesProgress`), otherwise
// the trim would make it impossible.
//
// add-supplements D9: the supplement templates have static weight 0 and
// are offered (weight 3) only while the supplement digest is active.
//
// Depends on: ChallengeCatalog (ladder families, hand-authored ids),
// ChallengeKind.dataRequirement, DataRequirement, FoodLogCore (DaySignals).
// Depended on by: ChallengeRotation.pickNext, ChallengeStore, the app's
// GamificationEngine (achievement context).
