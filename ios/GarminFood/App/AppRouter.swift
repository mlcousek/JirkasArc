// AppRouter.swift
//
// Where external entry points land (app-navigation spec): the selected tab,
// and a request for the Today tab to open the catalog. The shell applies
// widget links and Control requests here, so they work whichever screen was
// showing. The tab at launch is the user's start tab (Settings ->
// Appearance -> Layout); those entry points still take priority over it.
//
// rebrand-to-jirkas-arc D6/D8: the tab set depends on the experience
// (food-first: Today, Progress, Profile; training: Today, Plan, Progress,
// Profile). Which tab a route lands on, the start-tab fallback and the
// correction when the experience changes are AppearanceKit's pure
// `AppShell` rules; this class only applies them. `Tab` is AppShell's
// `ShellTab`, so there is one tab enum, not two to keep in step.
