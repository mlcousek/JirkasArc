// AppServices.swift
//
// One set of local stores per process (add-app-shell-and-meal-dashboard 1.1).
//
// Every store here is a JSON file read once and then kept in memory. Before
// this existed, `AppEnvironment` and each in-app intent (Control, Siri)
// opened their OWN instances on the same files. So an entry logged from a
// Control while the app was running went into a second in-memory copy: the
// app's copy never saw it, and the app's next save rewrote the file without
// it. The two outboxes also drained independently, each with its own
// "already draining" guard. Sharing one instance fixes both: every write
// goes through the same actor, and the actor's drain guard covers every
// caller.
//
// Compiled into the widget extension too (via `Shared/`), where it is
// simply never touched: the extension shows no data and runs no intents
// (add-glanceable-surfaces D1/D2).
