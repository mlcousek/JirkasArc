// expand-gamification-depth design.md D1's "levels also gain a tier/title"
// decision: a small, hand-written table of 20 named bands spanning the
// full level range, so level progress reads as more than a bare number
// without inventing one name per level (D1's own framing: a tier name +
// "Level 47" beats a thin per-level reskin).
//
// add-training-gamification-and-150-levels D5: the range is 1-150 now. The
// eleven tiers up to level 90 keep their names AND ranges, so nobody's
// title moves down when the curve changes; the nine above are re-banded to
// end at 150 (nobody was in them). No prestige: "Legend" is the end.
