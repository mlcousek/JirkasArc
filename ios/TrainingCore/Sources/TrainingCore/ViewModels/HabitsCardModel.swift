// HabitsCardModel.swift
//
// Today's Habits card as a pure model (polish-training-today D2, spec
// training-today "The habit ladder is tracked from Today"). The owner could
// not track the ladder: the old card listed only the habits the plan
// expected that day and hid itself otherwise, and the ladder was one tap
// behind it. This card shows whenever the plan has a ladder:
//
//   - where he stands: "Step 2 of 6" (the highest active step);
//   - the active habits (plus any the day expects), each with its 14-day
//     window against the gate and, when the plan expects it on the shown
//     day, the on/off tick of add-training-checkins (A42); an active habit
//     the day doesn't expect says "Not on today's plan" and has no tick;
//   - the day's progress: "1 of 2 done today", from the phone's latest
//     ticks over the projection's counts (`TrainingSnapshot.habitDone`);
//   - the next step and what unlocks it: "Gate met: ..." where the vault
//     says so, else "Unlocks when <current> holds 80 % over a 14-day
//     window", and its earliest start.
//
// The phone never decides a gate: `gateMet`, `window14` and the states are
// read from the projection. Rows reuse `HabitRowModel`
// (TodayTrainingModel.swift), so the tick and adherence rules stay one.
//
// Depended on by: the app's HabitsTodayCard (Training/TrainingTodayCards
// .swift). Tests: TodayBuilderTests.
