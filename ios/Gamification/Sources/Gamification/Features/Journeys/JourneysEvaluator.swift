// JourneysEvaluator.swift
//
// add-journeys-and-records design D1-D5: the pure step behind
// `JourneysFeature` -- given the stored state and one signals snapshot, it
// (1) advances each cumulative journey's `DailyLedger` (open days
// recomputed, older days folded into `sealedTotal` exactly once), (2) grows
// the passport's food-id set, and (3) reports every milestone the new totals
// crossed that wasn't reached before (several per journey and per day are
// fine -- each is reported once).
//
// Per-day values (days without the data contribute nothing):
//   - protein: `totals.protein` of a day with entries or a Garmin log,
//     converted at 0.5 m per gram;
//   - water: `waterML` in litres;
//   - road: `activeKcal` / the weight known ON THAT DAY (latest weigh-in in
//     the window on or before it, else the weight stored as of the last
//     sealed day, else 70 kg) -- so past distance never shifts when weight
//     changes later (design "Risks").
//
// `progress` turns a state into what the UI shows (position, last and next
// milestone, remaining distance, Podolí percentage).
//
// add-training-gamification-and-150-levels D9: `roadKilometresByDay` (the
// training experience) replaces the road trip's per-day value: a fixed
// distance on every kept plan day, nothing on any other day, whatever the
// active calories were. The ledger still counts each day exactly once.
//
// Depends on: DailyLedger, JourneyCatalog, JourneysState, FoodLogCore
// (SignalsSnapshot/DaySignals).
// Depended on by: JourneysFeature, JourneysTests.
