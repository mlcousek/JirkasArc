// BingoTask.swift
//
// add-weekly-bingo design D2: the shape of one bingo square's task -- a
// persisted `id` (cards store ids only, never display text), a difficulty
// used by the card composition (3 easy / 3 medium / 2 hard), a `family`
// (no two tasks of the same family on one card), and the rule written in
// the SHARED predicate vocabulary (`DayPredicate` for "on any single day of
// the week", `WeekPredicate` for "across the week so far"), so a bingo
// square and a boss rule that say the same thing are judged by the same
// `SignalEvaluator` code.
//
// `requirement` is derived from the rule, never hand-written, so a water
// square can never be offered to someone with no water data by mistake.
//
// add-training-gamification-and-150-levels D9: a third scope, `.training`,
// for the training experience's squares. Their rule is a count over the
// plan's facts (`TrainingBingoRule`, BingoTaskCatalog+Training.swift), not
// a predicate over the food snapshot; they need no food data, and they are
// offered only in that experience.
//
// Depends on: DayPredicate, WeekPredicate, DataRequirement.
// Depended on by: BingoTaskCatalog, BingoCardGenerator, BingoEvaluator,
// WeeklyBingoFeature, the app's BingoCardView.
