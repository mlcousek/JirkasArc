// Every string TrainingCore shows, as a case whose raw value is the English
// text -- the key in Resources/<lang>.lproj/Localizable.strings(dict)
// (TrainingText.swift). Generated together with those four tables from one
// list, so a case, its English and its Czech cannot drift apart;
// TrainingTextTests resolves every case in both languages. Plural keys
// (`.stringsdict`) are the English "other" form.
//
// Add a string: add the case here and the entry to BOTH lproj folders (en
// and cs), with the same format specifiers.
//
// Depended on by: TrainingText and every formatter and builder.
