// LogEntryEditing.swift
//
// Pure pieces of add-log-entry-editing that aren't the commit itself (that
// is `LogEntryCoordinator.edit`/`duplicate`/`copyMeal`):
//   - `CopyMealPlanner` (design.md D4): turns a past day's read-back
//     (`GET /nutrition-service/food/logs/{date}`, confirmed 2026-09-14 -- the
//     same read the Today tab already uses) into the items "Copy from…" can
//     re-log, and the ones it can't (calories-only quick adds, which have no
//     food or serving id to log again).
//   - `LogEntryEditError`, the reasons an edit/duplicate is refused before
//     anything is written.
//   - Two small adapters from GarminKit's read-back shapes, shared by
//     `MealDashboard` (MealEntry's re-log identity) and the planner.
//
// Why re-logging from the read-back is enough: a read entry carries
// `foodMetaData` (foodId, source, regionCode, languageCode) and
// `nutritionContent.servingId`/`servingQty` -- exactly what the confirmed
// create body needs (docs/garmin-food-log-contract.md), including the
// region/language a custom food's nutrition is stored under
// (fix-custom-food-log-region). No new Garmin route is involved anywhere.
//
// Depended on by: LogEntryCoordinator.swift, MealDashboard.swift, and the
// app's CopyMealSheet/EditEntrySheet. Depends on GarminKit's models only.
