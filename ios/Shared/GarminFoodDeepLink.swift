// GarminFoodDeepLink.swift
//
// Deep links this app's STATIC widgets use (design.md D2, REVISED
// 2026-09-14; sharpened 2026-09-22). Kept as its own tiny Shared type
// (compiled directly into both the GarminFood app target and the
// GarminFoodWidgetExtension target, per project.yml's `sources: [...,
// Shared]` on both) so the scheme string and each action's URL live in
// exactly one place instead of being duplicated as string literals in each
// widget file.
//
// Reuses the app's existing "garminfood" custom scheme, the same one
// registered in `ios/project.yml`'s `CFBundleURLTypes`, rather than adding
// a second one. Garmin sign-in no longer uses this scheme for anything
// (see GarminAuthSession.swift's 2026-09-16 real-device finding: it
// switched to a `WKWebView`-based ticket capture that doesn't depend on a
// custom-scheme redirect at all), so any "garminfood://" open -- including
// these, tapped from a widget -- falls through to the app's normal
// `onOpenURL(perform:)` handling like any other registered custom URL
// scheme. The extension itself never needs to receive an open, only to
// construct the URL the system routes elsewhere.
//
// 2026-09-22: both existing widgets are labeled "Log Food" and their whole
// point is getting the user logging as fast as possible -- but their link
// used to just switch to the Today tab and stop, leaving the user to tap
// "Log a food" again themselves. `Action.logFood` now names that intent
// explicitly and `AppRouter.handle(url:)` drives the user straight into the
// catalog screen (reusing the same `catalogRequested` mechanism the
// barcode-scan Control already relies on -- see AppRouter.swift), removing
// that redundant second tap. `Action` exists (rather than one bare URL) so
// a future widget with a genuinely different destination (e.g. Progress)
// has somewhere to add its own case instead of overloading this one.
//
// rebrand-to-jirkas-arc D8: `plan` (`garminfood://plan`, optional
// `?date=YYYY-MM-DD`) opens the Plan tab in the training experience and
// Today in the food-first one (AppearanceKit's `AppShell.destination`).
// Nothing sends it yet; it exists so later notifications and the race
// countdown have a target. The date is validated by the pure
// `AppShell.planLinkDate` and kept on AppRouter for the Plan tab.
//
// add-interactive-habits: `habits` (`garminfood://habits`, optional
// `?habit=<id>`) opens the Habits screen, or that habit's detail, on the
// Plan tab in the training experience, and Today in the food-first one.
// Nothing sends it yet either; it is the target for later notifications
// and widgets.
