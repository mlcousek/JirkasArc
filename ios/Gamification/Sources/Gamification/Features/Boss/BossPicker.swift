// BossPicker.swift
//
// add-weekly-boss-and-streak-freezes design D2: which boss the owner faces
// this ISO week, and how many hits it takes. Pure: the week, last week's
// boss and the signals snapshot in; a `BossPick` out. `WeeklyBossFeature`
// calls it once per week (first run of the week) and persists the result,
// so a boss is never re-rolled mid-week even when later data would change
// the analysis.
//
//   - Analysis window: the 28 days of the 4 ISO weeks before this one.
//   - Per archetype: considered = days passing its filter, adherence =
//     good / considered. Eligible when its data requirement is met by some
//     day in the window and considered >= 14 (the ghost: always, over 28).
//   - Fewer than 7 logged days in the window -> the forgetful ghost.
//   - Otherwise the eligible archetype with the LOWEST adherence, never
//     last week's boss; exact ties broken by `DeterministicRandom` seeded
//     "boss-<week>", over the tied kinds in catalog order.
//   - Target = clamp(ceil(adherence * 7) + 2, 3, 7).
//
// Fallback (not in the design, needed to keep "never twice in a row" and
// "new user -> ghost" both true): when the rule's choice is last week's
// boss and nothing else is eligible, the breakfast goblin (or, if IT was
// last week's boss, the ghost) is used, with its adherence over whatever
// days it has.
//
// add-training-gamification-and-150-levels D9: with the plan's facts
// (`training`, passed only in the training experience) the Impatience Imp
// is one more candidate. Its adherence is kept plan days / judged plan days
// among the analysis days, and it needs `minimumJudgedPlanDays` (10) of
// them. It then competes like every other archetype: the weakest habit
// wins, never twice in a row. Without `training` it has no considered day
// and is never eligible.
//
// Depends on: BossCatalog, WeekKey, DeterministicRandom, FoodLogCore
// (SignalsSnapshot), TrainingPlanSignals, TrainingXPRules.
// Depended on by: WeeklyBossFeature.
