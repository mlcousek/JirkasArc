// TrainingRecorder.swift
//
// The one entry point for every training action (add-training-checkins
// design D3-D5), used by the app's Today and session detail and by the
// lock-screen Controls (through the app's TrainingEventsService):
//
//   record   validate the payload, reserve ONE sequence number from
//            VaultKit's DeviceIdentityStore (persisted before it is
//            returned, so never reused), build the envelope (UUIDv7, the
//            wall clock with its offset) and append it to the local log.
//            Durable on return; no network, ever.
//   seal     this device's unsealed events -> segment files (EventSegment),
//            each ENQUEUED in VaultKit's write queue BEFORE its events are
//            marked sealed: a crash in between can put an event in two
//            segments (the vault dedupes by id) but can never lose one.
//   drain    seal, then deliver the queue with CreateOnlyFileUploader, then
//            prune old sealed events. Auth/offline/rate limits stop the
//            cycle without spending attempts (DurableQueue's rules).
//   overlay  the log folded over the queue's state (CheckInOverlay).
//   planEdits the plan commands in the log with their status: the queue's
//            state, the projection's acks and outcomes (PendingOverlay,
//            add-plan-editing).
//
// No device id (the connection was never tested successfully) means no
// recording at all: `record` throws `.noDeviceIdentity`, and the app keeps
// the capabilities off. WHETHER to drain (connection enabled, configured,
// token, request gate) is the caller's decision; this type only drains when
// asked, and VaultPathPolicy refuses anything outside the own folder
// regardless.
//
// `CheckInPlanning` resolves which training day and session a check-in is
// for, from the cached projection only (the Controls run at 4:00, maybe
// offline).
//
// Depended on by: the app's TrainingEventsService. Tests:
// TrainingRecorderTests.
