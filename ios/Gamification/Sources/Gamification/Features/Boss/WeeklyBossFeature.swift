// WeeklyBossFeature.swift
//
// add-weekly-boss-and-streak-freezes: the "boss" gamification feature
// (replaces the add-gamification-signals stub; the registry already creates
// it with `init(directory:)`). Two jobs, because both are this change's and
// the streak freeze is the boss's main reward:
//
// 1. THE WEEKLY BOSS (design D2/D3). Per run (`update`):
//    - settle every earlier week still marked active: recount its hits over
//      all seven (now complete) days, then defeated or escaped (no penalty);
//    - pick this ISO week's boss if none is stored yet (`BossPicker`, never
//      last week's) -> one intro moment;
//    - add today's hits (`BossFight`); hits >= target -> defeated -> one
//      defeat moment;
//    - save, THEN return: for every defeated week still kept,
//      `boss.defeat.<week>` (150-250 XP) and `boss.freeze.<week>` (a streak
//      freeze) -- re-emitted every run, applied once by `RewardLedger`, so a
//      failed ledger write heals itself. Keys use this feature's own id
//      namespace ("boss."); the host drops any other prefix.
//    - badges from the lifetime counters and from `StreakFreezeStore`
//      (the host skips already-unlocked ones), and the hub summary.
//    A boss store that exists but can't be read skips the run entirely.
//
// 2. STREAK FREEZES (design D4-D6). The app's `GamificationEngine` calls
//    `applyStreakFreezes` at the start of every refresh/confirm, BEFORE
//    computing the streak: it replays the balance, runs the pure
//    `StreakFreezePlanner`, records new consumptions in `StreakFreezeStore`
//    (owned here), and returns the frozen days plus one `.freeze` moment
//    per freeze just used. Local and fast; never the network.
//    add-supplements D9: with an active supplement digest the planner also
//    protects the supplement streak from the SAME pool (`planShared`).
//
// add-training-gamification-and-150-levels D9: in the training experience
// the picker may choose the Impatience Imp, whose hits are kept plan days
// (`context.trainingPlan`). The bestiary badge still needs the ten food
// archetypes only, and the bestiary lists the imp only in that experience
// or once it was defeated.
//
// Depends on: BossCatalog, BossPicker, BossFight, BossStore,
// StreakFreezeStore, StreakFreezePlanner, FreezeBalance, WeekKey.
// Depended on by: GamificationFeatureRegistry, the app's GamificationEngine
// (freezes) and boss screens (`currentBoss()`, `history()`, `bestiary()`).
