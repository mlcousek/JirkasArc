// SyncQueueView.swift
//
// profile-and-settings spec: every entry Garmin hasn't accepted, with its
// meal, date, state and last error, plus retry, delete and sync-now. This
// is the only place a `.failed` entry (one that has exhausted its retries)
// becomes actionable again.
//
// sync-weight-hydration-with-garmin: weigh-in adds/DELETES and drinks/
// corrections Garmin hasn't accepted are listed too, in their own section
// (spec: a failed weigh-in delete "is visible in the sync queue"). They can
// be retried here; a queued Garmin delete can also be cancelled (the
// weigh-in then stays in Garmin). Removing an add or a drink is done from
// the Weight/Water screens, which keep their local records consistent. A
// FAILED water entry can also be discarded here (2026-09-23), through
// `HydrationLogCoordinator.discardQueued`, which keeps the local list
// consistent too -- the only way out for a correction Garmin keeps
// rejecting.
//
// add-log-entry-editing: an edit whose corrected entry is already in Garmin
// but whose old entry isn't removed yet (`.createdAwaitingDelete`) is listed
// here too, so the temporary duplicate is never silent -- and, once parked
// (the delete gave up), offered a retry that only re-attempts the delete.
//
// improve-food-day-flow (E2): a queued delete of a synced food entry is
// listed too, in its own section -- waiting, or "Couldn't delete" with the
// last error once it gave up -- with "Retry" (given up only) and "Keep
// entry" (the delete is dropped and the entry stays in Garmin).
