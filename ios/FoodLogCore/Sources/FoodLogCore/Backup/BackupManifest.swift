// BackupManifest.swift
//
// add-data-safety D3/D4/D5: the self-description every backup carries --
// an on-device snapshot (`Backups/<id>/manifest.json`), the staged restore
// (`Backups/.pending-restore/manifest.json`) and an exported file
// (`BackupContainer.manifest`). Why a manifest at all rather than just the
// copied files: a restore has to decide, BEFORE touching anything, whether
// this build can read what it is about to put back (`BackupCompatibility`),
// and the Data screen / import preview need a date, an app version and a
// kind without opening every store file.
//
// Also holds `BackupContainer` (the single exported `.json` file: manifest +
// every data file as base64 + typed preferences; design D5 explains why a
// JSON container and not a zip) and `BackupCompatibility` (the refusal rules
// of D4). Pure Codable -- testable with `swift test`, no UI, no network.
// `BackupContainer.decode` also reads the file gzip-compressed, as the
// weekly vault backup writes it (add-vault-backup, BackupArchive.swift).
//
// Depends on: StoreCatalog (store ids and versions), PreferenceValue.
// Depended on by: BackupVault, BackupPreview, the app's DataSafetyController.
