## Context

`LevelCurve` (Gamification) maps total XP to a level with a geometric
threshold curve: base 100 XP for level 1→2, growth factor `1.0505`, and a
cap of 200. The tuning history is in its header comment:

- 1.3 made levels unreachable;
- 2026-09-18 set 1.045, which reaches level 84 in about 3 years at
  ~75 XP/day;
- 2026-09-24 set 1.0505, because new sources were estimated to add
  ~31 XP/day.

`XPStore` keeps `peakLevel`, so a curve change never lowers the displayed
level. That estimate was made before the features were built. This change
replaces tuning by estimate with a budget table that tests can check.

## Decisions

### D1 — The pace target

**Level 84 after 3 years (1,095 days) of a typical active day.** This is the
promise from the 2026-09-18 retune that the owner has seen. Secondary
checks: level 10 within 7–21 days, level 50 within 150–300 days. All three
are asserted in tests.

**Why the secondary windows changed during implementation (owner-approved
2026-09-25).** The first draft copied "level 10 in 2–5 weeks, level 50 in
9–15 months" from the 2026-09-18 table, and that table was wrong. At
1.045 and 75 XP/day, level 50 needs ~16.8k XP, which is 224 days, not ~1
year. With the base fixed at 100 XP, solving the factor for level 84 at
1,095 days always puts level 50 at ~170–225 days and level 10 at ~9–14
days, whatever the daily XP. Meeting the old windows would need a base of
~250–400 XP plus a factor of ~1.03–1.038. That would give existing users
1–2 months with no level-ups and a progress bar stuck at 0: a user at
~3k XP would stall 34–49 days. So the base stays 100, only the factor is
solved, and the secondary windows now describe the curve that ships. On it
(1.05358, at ≈ 128 XP/day): level 10 in ≈ 9 days (1,119 XP), level 50 in
≈ 174 days (22,217 XP), level 84 in ≈ 1,095 days (140,168 XP).

**What existing users see.** No level drops (`peakLevel`, D5). The owner
has ≈ 3k XP; the 2026-09-24 migration seeded peak level 20 from 1.045. On
the new curve 3,000 XP is level 19, so level 20 stays displayed with the
bar at 0 for ≈ 1.3 days, and level 21 arrives after ≈ 3.4 days of typical
XP (≈ 2.5 days on 1.0505): about one extra day. A much larger ledger with a
1.045-seeded peak would wait longer (12k XP, peak 43: ≈ 29 days to level 44
instead of ≈ 20), but no such ledger exists. `XPCurveMigrationTests`
simulates the owner's ledger.

### D2 — `XPBudget` (pure)

```swift
public struct XPBudgetLine { let source: String; let expectedDailyXP: Double; let optional: Bool }
public enum XPBudget {
    static let lines: [XPBudgetLine]           // one per source, reviewed in code review
    static var coreDailyXP: Double             // sum of non-optional lines
    static func solveGrowthFactor(targetLevel: Int, days: Int, dailyXP: Double) -> Double
}
```

- **Expected values.** Each line's value is the *long-run average per day*
  for a typical active user. Examples: a line bonus paid about 1.5 times a
  week counts as `25 × 1.5 / 7`; secrets are one-offs spread over 3 years.
- **Documentation.** The table lives in one file, with a comment per line
  giving the source constant and its assumed frequency.
- **Solving the factor.** `solveGrowthFactor` bisects the factor in
  [1.0, 1.2] until the cumulative XP to reach `targetLevel` equals
  `days × dailyXP`, to within 0.1%.
- **Pinning.** `LevelCurve.growthFactor` stays a literal constant, for
  deterministic and cheap builds. The test
  `testGrowthFactorMatchesBudget` checks that the literal matches the
  solved value to within 1e-4. It fails when someone changes rewards or
  adds a source without re-solving, and its failure message prints the
  value to paste in.
- **Registry check.** A second test enumerates
  `GamificationFeatureRegistry.makeAll` and requires one budget line per
  feature id. A new feature can't skip the budget.

### D3 — Audit of shipped amounts (to verify during implementation)

Every shipped reward constant, read from the code on 2026-09-25 (task 1.1).
Feature badges also pay `XPAward.achievementBonus` (30 XP) on unlock
(`FeatureHost`), so each feature line includes its badge unlocks.
"≈ XP/day" is the line's value in `XPBudget.lines`, which is the
authoritative copy.

| Source (budget line) | Shipped reward (constant) | Frequency assumption | ≈ XP/day |
|---|---|---|---|
| `log` | 10 / entry (`XPAward.flatPerLog`) | 3.5 entries a day | 35.0 |
| `streak` | 20 / day (`streakExtensionBonus`) | every active day | 20.0 |
| `goal` | 25 / day (`goalHitBonus`) | 60% of days | 15.0 |
| `dailyChallenge` | 15 each (`dailyChallengeBonus`), 2 a day | 60% completed | 18.0 |
| `challenge` | 50 hand-authored (`challengeCompletionBonus`), ladders 45–300, creative 60–130; rotation-weighted mean ≈ 84 (assumed 85, checked ±10% by a test) | 1 completion / 9 days (one slot, ~7-day windows) | 9.4 |
| `achievement` | 30 / core badge (`achievementBonus`) | 15 unlocks a year | 1.2 |
| `bingo` | 25 / line (`bingoLine`); **150** full card + freeze (`bingoFullCard`) | lines 1.5/week; full card 1 in 8 weeks; 6 badges in 3 years | 8.2 |
| `seasonal` | 50 / event per year (`seasonalEventCompleted`); 25 / bonus quest (`SeasonalEventCatalog.bonusQuestXP`) | 6 of 12 events and 3 of 8 bonus quests a year; 10 badges in 3 years | 1.3 |
| `collections` | 5 / discovery (`collectionDiscovery`), 85 entries | 1 discovery / 2 weeks; 6 badges in 3 years | 0.5 |
| `journeys` | 40 / milestone (`journeyMilestone`), 44 milestones | 40 milestones in 3 years (~1/month); 8 badges | 1.7 |
| `records` | 20 / PR (`personalRecord`), max 1 per record per day | 3 PRs a month; 3 badges in 3 years | 2.1 |
| `secrets` | 50 (`secretUnlocked`) + 30 badge, 16 secrets | 12 found in 3 years | 0.9 |
| `sportBody` | 0 (`sportBadge`) + 30 badge | 10 badges in 3 years | 0.3 |
| `boss` | 150 + 25 per target day above 3 (`bossDefeatedBase`, `bossDefeatedPerTargetDay`): 150–250 | 0.5 defeats/week at target 5 (200 XP); 6 badges in 3 years | 14.5 |
| **core total** | | | **≈ 128.0** |

Corrections to the earlier notes: the bingo full card pays **150 XP**, not
350 (the constant never changed); sport & body pays only the generic badge
bonus.

Retune rule: if one wave-2 feature's expected daily XP is more than 25% of
`coreDailyXP`, reduce its constants rather than steepen the curve for
everyone. **Result (task 1.3): no feature exceeds it.** The largest is the
weekly boss at ≈ 14.5 XP/day, 11% of ≈ 128 (the limit is ≈ 32). Bingo is
≈ 8.2 (6%). **No reward constants were changed.** The test
`testNoWaveTwoFeatureExceedsAQuarterOfCore` enforces the rule from now on.

### D4 — Optional sources (supplements)

The curve is solved for `coreDailyXP` only. Optional sources share one
**allowance**: together they may add at most 0.5% of the core budget
(`XPBudget.optionalPaceAllowance`). While any are enabled, every optional
grant is scaled by

`m = min(1, 0.005 × coreDailyXP / Σ expectedDailyXP of the enabled optional lines)`

```swift
XPBudget.optionalMultiplier(enabledOptionalSources: Set<String>) -> Double
XPBudget.scaledGrant(_ xp: Int, multiplier: Double) -> Int   // rounded, min 1 for xp > 0
XPBudget.optionalGrantXP(_ xp: Int, enabledOptionalSources:) // the two combined
```

The feature applies it when it fills its `RewardGrant.xp`; `RewardLedger`
then pays the amount as-is. As a result, a user with supplements on levels
at the same pace (±1%) as one without.

- **Why an allowance, not a full offset.** The first draft used
  `m = 1 − optional / (core + optional)`, which only shrinks optional XP by
  a few percent: a 10 XP/day source still added ≈ 7% to the pace. The
  allowance caps the effect directly, and the ±1% test follows from it.
- **Minimum grant of 1.** A grant never silently pays nothing, so a source
  may exceed its scaled budget when it pays many tiny grants. At ≈ 128
  XP/day core, one 1-XP grant a day is 0.8%, inside ±1%. An optional
  source should therefore pay at most about one grant a day.
- Supplements are budgeted at a small daily amount (see `add-supplements`
  D9) before the multiplier, and add their `optional: true` line to
  `XPBudget.lines` once this change has merged.
- The multiplier comes from the same table, so a test can check it
  (`testOptionalSourceKeepsLevel84WithinOnePercent`).

### D5 — Migration

- When the constant changes, `XPStore` seeds `peakLevel` from the level
  under the *previous* factor, exactly as the 2026-09-24 migration did with
  `legacyGrowthFactor`. A one-level-ever-reached guarantee is kept.
- `legacyGrowthFactor` becomes a list of past factors: `[1.045, 1.0505]`.
  The seed takes the max level over all of them.

### D6 — Testing

- Solver: known curve round-trips, and monotonicity.
- Pace checks from D1.
- Registry-to-budget coverage.
- Migration: an XP total that was level N under 1.0505 is never shown below
  N.
- Multiplier: with an optional line enabled, the simulated days to level 84
  are within ±1% of the core-only figure.
- Owner ledger: ≈ 3k XP with peak 20 reaches level 21 within 5 typical
  days, and the displayed level never drops (`XPCurveMigrationTests`).

## Risks / Trade-offs

- **Estimates are still estimates.** The table makes them explicit and
  reviewable, but real usage may differ. A later tweak is a one-line table
  change plus a re-solved constant.
- **A steeper curve can make the next level feel far away.** `peakLevel`
  stops any drop. The "XP to next level" bar may jump once after the update,
  which is acceptable and mentioned in the release notes.

## Open Questions

- None blocking. The owner chose "calibrate the whole XP economy" on
  2026-09-25.
