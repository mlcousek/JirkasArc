// ProjectionStore.swift
//
// The last good plan, always available, and an honest age (spec "The last
// good plan is always available and its age is honest", design D5):
//
//   - `validate(_:)` is the validator the app hands `ConditionalFileSync`
//     (add-vault-connection): the D2 decode, throwing for an invalid or a
//     too-new file, so neither ever replaces the last good copy and the
//     rejected ETag is remembered there;
//   - `loadCached()` decodes the last good bytes off the main actor,
//     without the network, so a cold launch offline shows the plan at
//     once; it decodes each new copy once and logs its dropped elements in
//     ONE Diagnostics line (design D2);
//   - `noteRefresh(_:)` folds a refresh's report in: a rejection is kept
//     (and reported on Today and Plan) until a good copy arrives;
//   - `refresh(via:inputs:force:)` is the app's one refresh step (the
//     coordinator's gated GET, this validator, `noteRefresh`), used for the
//     foreground fetch and the setup fetch (polish-training-today D1).
//
// There is no store file of its own: the only copy of the projection is
// VaultKit's cache (excluded from backups; the vault is the system of
// record). A rejection's reason lives in memory; the app keeps it across
// launches while VaultKit still remembers a rejected ETag.
//
// Freshness never uses `generatedAt` (the vault writes the file only when
// its content changes): `TrainingFreshness` below reads `asOf` against the
// training day and the last successful sync against a 24-hour threshold
// (owner decision 0.3, defaulted).
//
// add-training-gamification-and-150-levels D6: `cachedRewardExtras()` reads
// the few fields the training rewards need that `Projection` does not model
// yet, from the same last good bytes (ProjectionRewardExtras.swift).
//
// Depended on by: the app's TrainingModel and VaultServices. Tests:
// ProjectionStoreTests (in-memory transport, real ConditionalFileSync).
