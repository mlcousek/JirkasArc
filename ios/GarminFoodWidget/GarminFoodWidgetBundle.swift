// GarminFoodWidgetBundle.swift
//
// The widget extension's entry point (`GarminFoodWidgetExtension`, see
// ios/project.yml). Task 6.4's throwaway Keychain-sharing spike widget
// (formerly KeychainCheckWidget.swift, now removed) is gone -- its job was
// answering one empirical question, and its answer (no App Group, no
// Keychain Sharing on this free-tier account -- `errSecMissingEntitlement`
// / -34018, confirmed live) is recorded in openspec/config.yaml's Hard
// Constraints and is exactly what shaped every real widget/Control below:
// none of them can ever show live data (design.md D2), and the logging
// Controls must foreground the app rather than run invisibly (design.md D1).
//
// Widgets and Controls are declared together in this one `WidgetBundle`,
// per Apple's WWDC24 "Extend your app's controls across the system"
// session, which demonstrates adding a `ControlWidget`-conforming type
// directly into an existing `WidgetBundle`'s `body` alongside ordinary
// `Widget`s -- no separate extension/target needed for Controls, matching
// design.md's own framing ("the same API surfaces in Control Center...
// from one implementation") and ios/project.yml's comment that "a Control
// can live in the same extension bundle."
//
// Controls are iOS 18+ only (design.md's Context section); the `Widget`
// entries are not, so they're listed unconditionally and the Controls are
// gated behind `if #available` rather than bumping this target's whole
// deployment target off of 17.0.
//
// add-training-shortcuts-and-widgets: two more widgets (the check-in
// buttons, iOS 17's interactive widgets; the countdown) and two more
// Controls (water, weight). The new Controls sit in a SECOND
// `if #available` block on purpose: the first already lists eight, and a
// result-builder block takes a limited number of entries (ten in SwiftUI's
// own builders) -- two blocks keep both well under it.
