// FoodLogging.swift
//
// The write seam of add-standalone-mode (design D4): every food-log WRITE
// the app makes, as one protocol, so wave 2 can add a local system of
// record (`LocalLogEntryCoordinator`, writing `LocalFoodLogStore`) beside
// the Garmin one without touching a single view or intent.
//
// The surface is exactly `LogEntryCoordinator`'s public API as it stood
// before this change, plus `deleteCommitted(logId:date:)` -- the `.synced`
// delete that used to sit inline in `DayLogLoader.delete` (a direct
// `GarminClient.deleteFoodLogEntries` call). `LogEntryCoordinator` conforms
// with its bodies unchanged.
//
// Protocol requirements can't carry default arguments, so callers never
// hold `any FoodLogging` for the defaulted calls: they hold
// `ModeRoutingFoodLogging` (below), whose methods repeat
// `LogEntryCoordinator`'s exact signatures INCLUDING the defaults, and which
// forwards everything with every argument spelled out. That keeps every
// existing call site (views, `AppEnvironment`, Siri/Control intents)
// compiling unchanged, with no protocol-extension overloads that could make
// a concrete `LogEntryCoordinator` call ambiguous.
//
// Wave 2 (task 2.5): `LocalLogEntryCoordinator` is the second
// implementation, and the router picks it on every call while the
// effective `DataMode` is `.standalone` (only reachable through the hidden
// testing toggle until onboarding exists). Garmin mode forwards exactly as
// in wave 1.
//
// Depended on by: Shared/AppServices.swift (holds the one router per
// process as `logEntryCoordinator`), GarminFood/Today/DayLogLoader.swift
// (deletes), and every confirm/edit/duplicate/copy caller through
// `AppServices`/`AppEnvironment`.
