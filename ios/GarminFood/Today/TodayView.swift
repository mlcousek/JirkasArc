// TodayView.swift
//
// The Today tab (meal-dashboard spec): the day as Garmin Connect's food page
// shows it. There's a day switcher and a summary against the daily target,
// then one card per meal with its foods and consumed-vs-suggested calories
// and macros. Queued entries appear in their meal before they reach Garmin.
// Adding from a meal pre-selects that meal and day.
//
// `FastingHomeSection` (redesign-fasting-schedule, `GarminFood/Fasting/
// FastingHomeCard.swift`) is the always-on fasting card while the daily
// fasting window is enabled, placed right under the streak strip since the
// owner checks it day to day. Tapping it pushes `FastingHistoryView`.
//
// The "Weight & Water" section (2026-09-22, `TodayWeightHydrationSection.
// swift`) is the last thing in the scroll view, below the meal-preset
// shelf: both trackers already live one tap away on the Progress tab, so
// this is a second, more convenient entry point rather than these screens'
// primary home -- it reads last, after food logging, which is what this
// screen is actually for. Always shown (unlike the quick-pick/meal-preset
// shelves above it, which hide when empty): an empty weight/hydration
// history is itself useful information here ("log your weight to start"),
// and the water card's quick-add row is useful with zero history too.
//
// add-themes-and-layout (design.md D8, wave 3): the cards are no longer a
// fixed stack. The body renders `LayoutStore`'s resolved Today order through
// one `@ViewBuilder switch` over `TodayCardID` (`todayCard(_:variant:)`), showing
// a card only when the user left it visible AND `availability(_:)` says it
// has something to show. The show-when rules that used to be `if`s here
// (Log again / Log a meal only on today's date and non-empty, fasting only
// while enabled) moved into `availability(_:)` unchanged. With nothing
// stored, the order is exactly the one described above (golden test:
// AppearanceKit's LayoutResolverTests), so a user who never edits sees no
// change. "Edit layout…" in the toolbar menu opens `LayoutEditorSheet` at
// half height over this screen, which updates live underneath it.
//
// add-training-today-and-plan (design D7): in the training experience four
// training cards lead the screen -- the next race, the day's training with
// its G/A/R options, the habits (polish-training-today D2: the Habits card,
// the ladder step with today's ticks, right after the check-in) and the
// weekly note
// (Training/TrainingTodayCards.swift). They follow the day switcher
// through `TrainingModel.trainingDay` (the plan's time zone and day
// boundary), are hidden when their data is absent, and are read-only:
// tapping an option pushes the session detail. The food cards below log
// exactly as in the food-first experience, which never lists or renders a
// training card (its catalog has none).
