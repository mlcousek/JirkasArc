// ChallengeTemplates.swift
//
// Challenges spec's "curated, hand-authored set" requirement (design.md D4,
// task 25.1): 13 templates, a plain data table (`ChallengeCatalog.all`)
// plus a shared, parameterised evaluation function (`ChallengeEngine`,
// separate file) -- deliberately NOT an authoring engine, per D4's explicit
// scope line.
//
// MEAL-TIME BUCKETS ARE A TIME-OF-DAY HEURISTIC, NOT THE REAL MEAL TYPE --
// worth being very explicit about, since a couple of these templates are
// styled directly on the proposal's own "log breakfast 5 days this week"
// example: `UsageEvent` (FoodLogCore/UsageHistory.swift) does NOT persist
// the `MealType` the user actually picked on the confirm screen -- only
// `foodId`/`servingId`/`numberOfUnits`/`timestamp`. The real, user-chosen
// meal type only ever reaches `GarminKit.Outbox`/Garmin's own log, neither
// of which this package reads. So "breakfast" here means "logged within
// the same generic time-of-day window `FoodLogCore.MealTypeDefaulting`
// itself defaults new entries from" -- intentionally mirroring those exact
// hour boundaries (rather than inventing different ones) so this package's
// idea of "breakfast time" agrees with the app's own default meal-type
// picker, even though the two are computed independently (this package
// does not depend on GarminKit, so it cannot name `GarminKit.MealType`
// itself -- see Package.swift's header for why that dependency was left
// out). If the user overrides the suggested meal type on the confirm
// screen (logs a 7am snack instead of breakfast, say), these templates
// will not know that. Accepted as a real, named limitation, not an
// oversight.
//
// UPDATE 2026-09-23 (improve-log-food-shelves): `UsageEvent` now carries an
// OPTIONAL `mealType` for events logged from then on. These templates still
// use the time-of-day bucket on purpose: every event older than that has no
// meal type, so switching would silently change challenge progress for
// history that never changed. Revisit once the pre-upgrade events have aged
// out of the 500-event usage-history cap.
