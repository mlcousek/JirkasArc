// BackgroundOutboxDeliveryTests.swift
//
// fix-review-findings-2026-09 finding 3: the background refresh must move
// a weight-only or water-only queue, not just food, and a refresh must stay
// scheduled while any kind is still waiting. Finding 8: a food entry Garmin
// accepted whose re-read failed (`.sent`) must be reconciled by a LATER
// background pass, and keep a refresh scheduled until it is. Runs `BackgroundOutboxDelivery`
// (the code BackgroundRefresh.run calls) against REAL outboxes on unique
// temp files and a fake Garmin that never touches the network.
//
// improve-food-day-flow (E2): a queue holding only a DELETE of a synced
// food entry is delivered in the background too, and keeps a refresh
// scheduled while it waits -- but not once it gave up.
