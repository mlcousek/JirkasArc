// XPStore.swift
//
// Levels spec's "Logging awards XP, with larger awards for consistency than
// volume" requirement (design.md D3, task 24.1).
//
// WHY THIS IS A PERSISTED COUNTER, NOT A FULLY-DERIVED PURE FUNCTION (worth
// recording, since design.md's Goals explicitly want "a pure function of
// local log data" and this is the one place that is not literally true):
// total XP could, in principle, be recomputed on every call purely from
// `UsageEvent` history plus `GoalStatusStore`, with no counter persisted at
// all. That was the first design tried here. It does not actually work,
// because `UsageHistoryStore` caps itself at 500 events and silently trims
// the oldest ones (UsageHistory.swift's own doc comment) -- so a "total XP"
// recomputed from the current snapshot of usage history would PLATEAU
// permanently once a user passes ~500 lifetime logs (roughly 4-6 months at
// a few logs/day), since events keep aging out of the very data the total
// is derived from. A level that can never increase again well within a
// year of normal use defeats the entire point of levels. So XP is instead
// a small persisted running total -- genuinely a ledger, in the accounting
// sense: each log appends an award, the balance accumulates, and the
// balance survives independently of how much raw log history
// `UsageHistoryStore` still happens to be holding onto. Everything else in
// this package (streaks, level-from-XP, challenge progress) stays a pure
// function; this is the one deliberate, documented exception.
//
// Same JSON-file-actor pattern as `FoodLogCore.UsageHistoryStore` /
// `GoalStatusStore` above.
