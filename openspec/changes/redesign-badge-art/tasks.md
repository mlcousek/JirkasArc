Every wave ends with CI green. All art is hand-written SVG in the subset of
design D3. No app drawing code changes before task 2.4 is ticked by the
owner. Relative size: S / M / L.

## 0. Owner decisions

Each has a default; unanswered ones are built as the default.

- [ ] 0.1 Style: sticker (outlined, cel-shaded; default) or the flatter modern variant (design D1).
- [ ] 0.2 A locked badge shows its family shape in grey (default) or stays a plain grey disc (D5).
- [ ] 0.3 Any badge with its own one-off picture in the first release (default: none).

## 1. Wave 1 - style sample (M)

- [ ] 1.1 `ios/GarminFood/BadgeArt/` sources: the 13 frame shapes at one rarity (common), the five rarity trims on one shape (streak), and 10 motifs (flame, fork and knife, plate, scale, water drop, moon, star, crown, capsule, question mark).
- [ ] 1.2 `tools/docs/lint-badge-svg.mjs`: the allowed subset, a 24 x 24 motif view box and 64 x 64 frame view box, total size; wired into `.github/workflows/build.yml`'s localization job (no macOS needed).
- [ ] 1.3 `tools/docs/build-badge-gallery.mjs` -> `docs/guide/badges.html`: the sample at 44, 60 and 120 pt, locked and unlocked, light and dark, both style variants side by side.
- [ ] 1.4 Owner looks at the gallery and answers 0.1 to 0.3; record the answers in design.md.

## 2. Wave 2 - the full set and the catalog (L)

- [ ] 2.1 `ios/Gamification/Sources/Gamification/BadgeArtCatalog.swift`: badge id -> (family, motif); family from each badge's existing category; header comment per house style.
- [ ] 2.2 Tests: every badge id from every badge source (core, secrets, bingo, boss, journeys, records, collections, seasonal, sport and body, supplements, training, level tiers) resolves; no unknown family or motif name.
- [ ] 2.3 The remaining frames (13 shapes x 5 rarities) and motifs (about 60); `tools/docs/check-badge-art.mjs` fails when the catalog and the files disagree, in CI.
- [ ] 2.4 The gallery shows all badges with a family filter; **owner approves it** (the gate for wave 3).

## 3. Wave 3 - the app (M)

- [ ] 3.1 Imagesets in `Assets.xcassets` generated from the sources by a script (vector preserved, original rendering); the script is re-runnable and its output is committed.
- [ ] 3.2 One family only (streak) in `BadgeMedallion`: frame + motif, the locked silhouette, the fallback to the disc; the other families still use the disc. Sideload and compare with the gallery at 40, 60 and 120 pt. Record what differed.
- [ ] 3.3 All families; the 11 call sites pass the badge (or its family and motif); the secret question-mark frame; the existing shine kept for epic and legendary.
- [ ] 3.4 Accessibility: labels name the rarity; Differentiate Without Colour and the largest Dynamic Type checked on the Achievements grid.
- [ ] 3.5 `BadgeMedallion.swift`'s header rewritten (the "no image assets" reasoning no longer holds); `docs/guide/` links the gallery.

## 4. Verification

- [ ] 4.1 CI green; `openspec validate redesign-badge-art --strict` passes.
- [ ] 4.2 On device: Achievements grid and detail, the unlock moment, level tiers, sport and body, seasonal, supplements; light and dark; every theme. No empty or misdrawn badge.
- [ ] 4.3 App size before and after noted here (budget: under 400 KB added).
