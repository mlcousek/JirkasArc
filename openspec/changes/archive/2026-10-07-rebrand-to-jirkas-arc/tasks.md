Every task ends with CI green: `swift test` for every package, the design-token
lint, the app and widget `xcodebuild`, and the `localization` job. Every new
`.swift` file starts with a header comment saying why it exists and what
depends on it. All new and changed user-facing text is in English and Czech
(Czech plural forms for counts). Branch `mlcousek/rebrand-to-jirkas-arc`,
one PR per wave. Relative size: S / M / L. Built in parallel with
`add-vault-connection`.

## 0. Owner decisions (before wave 2)

Each has a proposed default. If no answer arrives before the wave that
needs it, the default is built and marked *defaulted, owner may override*.

- [x] 0.1 Icon concept: A (arc + "you are here" dot, default), B ("j" sweeping into the arc) or C (arc-shaped "A" with the dot as crossbar). Answer after seeing one rendered 1024 px PNG of each, attached to the PR (design D3). *Answered 2026-09-28 (A26): concept A. Built as A; the other concepts were not rendered. Review sheet: `icon-contact-sheet.png` in this folder.*
- [x] 0.2 Czech display name: "Jirka's Arc" unchanged (default) or a Czech form (design D2). *Answered 2026-09-28 (owner decisions A26): the default.*
- [x] 0.3 The fiancée's install: the same "Jirka's Arc" build (default), or a second CI artifact built with `APP_DISPLAY_NAME="Arc"` (design D2, D10). *Answered 2026-09-28 (owner decisions A26): the default.*
- [x] 0.4 Marketing version 2.0 (default) or 1.x (design D5). *Answered 2026-09-28 (owner decisions A26): the default.*
- [x] 0.5 Four tabs with food on Today (default), or five with a separate Food tab (design D6). *Answered 2026-09-28 (owner decisions A26): the default.*

## 1. Wave 1 — Experience shell (pure logic first) (M)

- [x] 1.1 AppearanceKit: `AppExperience` (`foodFirst`, `training`) and `AppShell` (`tabs(for:)`, `resolvedStartTab(stored:experience:)`); `StartTab.plan`. Tests `AppShellTests`: the food-first tab set equals today's three tabs in order; training is Today · Plan · Progress · Profile; resolved start tab for every stored value × experience, including an unknown string and `plan` in food-first.
- [x] 1.2 AppearanceKit: `LayoutCatalog.today(for:)` and `specs(for:experience:)`; the training catalog equals the food-first one for now. Golden test: `today(for: .foodFirst)` equals the pre-change catalog exactly. Existing callers pass the current experience.
- [x] 1.3 App: `AppRouter.Tab.plan`; `selectedTab` corrected to Today when the experience changes and the tab isn't shown; start tab from `AppShell.resolvedStartTab`.
- [x] 1.4 App: `ContentView` builds its tabs from `AppShell.tabs(for:)`, each in its own `NavigationStack` with `withStatusBanners()`; Today's title "Food log" (food-first) or "Today" (training); Today's tab icon `fork.knife` or `sun.max`; Plan `calendar`.
- [x] 1.5 App: `Plan/PlanTabView.swift`: the empty state only ("Your plan shows here once a vault is connected" plus a one-line explanation), built from the design-system `EmptyStateView`.
- [x] 1.6 `Shared/GarminFoodDeepLink`: `plan` action with optional `date`; `AppRouter.handle(url:)` opens Plan in training and Today in food-first; the pending date is kept on the router for the Plan tab (consumed in `add-training-today-and-plan`). `logFood`, theme links and the barcode route unchanged. Parsing tests where the parser is pure. *The date parser is AppearanceKit's pure `AppShell.planLinkDate` (tested in `AppShellTests`); route targets are `AppShell.destination(for:experience:)`.*
- [x] 1.7 Settings → Diagnostics: "Preview training shell (testing)" toggle (English only, developer surface), stored in `AppPreferences`; the app's experience input is `previewTraining` until `add-training-today-and-plan` adds the vault input. *Key `developer.previewTrainingShell.v1` (the `developer.` prefix keeps it out of backups). Czech added anyway, like "Force standalone mode (testing)": `--scan` requires Czech for every `Text` literal.*
- [x] 1.8 Appearance → Layout: the "Start on" picker lists only the current experience's tabs.
- [x] 1.9 Czech strings for every new key (tab title "Today"/"Dnes" is existing; "Plan", the empty state, the picker option). `node tools/check-localizations.mjs --scan` passes. *Czech keeps the word "vault" (Tvůj plán se tu ukáže, jakmile připojíš vault), matching how the owner names it; revisit if add-vault-connection picks another Czech term.*
- [ ] 1.10 On-device: with the toggle off, the app is indistinguishable from the previous build (tabs, titles, Today order, start tab). With it on: four tabs, "Today" title, Plan empty state, `garminfood://plan` from Safari opens Plan, the barcode Control from the Plan tab still opens the scanner on Today.

## 2. Wave 2 — Name and version (M)

- [x] 2.1 `project.yml`: `APP_DISPLAY_NAME: "Jirka's Arc"`, `MARKETING_VERSION: "2.0"`, `CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION: "1"` in base settings; `CFBundleDisplayName: $(APP_DISPLAY_NAME)`, `CFBundleShortVersionString: $(MARKETING_VERSION)`, `CFBundleVersion: $(CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION)` in both targets' `info.properties`. No identifier changes; update the manifest's header comment (why display-name-only, D1).
- [x] 2.2 `InfoPlist.xcstrings` (app and widget): `CFBundleDisplayName` with `shouldTranslate: false` and no Czech value (the widget's "Widget GarminFood" entry removed); `NSCameraUsageDescription` English value in `project.yml` and its Czech value name "Jirka's Arc".
- [ ] 2.3 `build.yml`: pass `CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION=${{ github.run_number }}` to the archive step; add a non-blocking step that prints `CFBundleShortVersionString`/`CFBundleVersion`/`CFBundleDisplayName` from the archived app and widget `Info.plist`s. Record the first run's output (run number and printed values) here. *Implemented; awaiting the first CI run (not pushed yet), whose run number and printed values go here.*
- [x] 2.4 String audit (design D2): each of the 33 app-catalog and 15 widget-catalog keys naming GarminFood, FoodLogCore's challenge notification (`en`/`cs` `.lproj`), `LogNamedFoodIntent`'s `Summary`, `OpenBarcodeScannerIntent`'s type display name, the two widget accessibility hints and `ProfileView`'s fallback name: app → "Jirka's Arc", Garmin-the-service unchanged. New keys with Czech, old keys removed. PR description lists a grep showing no user-facing "GarminFood" left (comments and identifiers excepted). *Done: 32 app-catalog keys (the 33rd, the testing-only bridge spike's "iCloud Drive › GarminFood Bridge", names a folder path and stays) and all 15 widget-catalog keys. Grep for the PR description: `grep -rn '"[^"]*GarminFood[^"]*"' ios --include=*.swift` leaves only identifiers (store paths, the bridge folder, the backup marker's English diagnostic, the Open Food Facts User-Agent, the repository URL); no catalog value contains "GarminFood" except the bridge folder path.*
- [x] 2.5 Settings → About text (design D2) in both data modes, per experience: the training plan is named only in the training experience (`AppExperience.mentionsTrainingPlan`, tested in `AppShellTests`); food-first says "food and weight" (EN + CS).
- [x] 2.6 FoodLogCore `BackupVault`: export file name `JirkasArc-backup-yyyy-MM-dd.json`; manifest marker unchanged. Test: the new name; a container written by the previous build (existing fixture) still passes `BackupCompatibility`.
- [x] 2.7 `README.md` and `CLAUDE.md`: name the app "Jirka's Arc (repository, targets and identifiers still named GarminFood)"; keep every path as is.

## 3. Wave 3 — Icon and signature (M)

- [x] 3.1 `tools/generate-app-icons.py`: record the current primary's corner colours as a `Teal` entry; add the one-time extraction of `tools/icon-src/by-jirka-mask.png` from the current primary (commit the mask); draw the chosen concept (0.1) procedurally at 4096 px and downsample; coverage = max(glyph, mask); write the primary `AppIcon-1024.png` and the 22 alternates (same names); keep `--check`. Update the script's docstring (why, inputs, outputs).
- [x] 3.2 Run the generator on Windows, commit the PNGs, attach a contact sheet of all 12 icons to the PR for the owner's review; `--check` exits 0. *Regenerated with Pillow 12.3 on Windows; `--check` reports 0.00 and exits 0. Contact sheet committed as `icon-contact-sheet.png` (attach it to the PR).*
- [x] 3.3 `DesignSystem/ArcMark.swift` (the `Shape`) and `AppSignatureView` using it with the existing gradient token; VoiceOver label "Jirka's Arc, by Jirka"; the onboarding welcome page shows `ArcMark` instead of any "GF" text. Design-token lint passes with no new allowlist entry.
- [ ] 3.4 On-device: every theme's icon from Settings → Appearance switches and shows the arc; the signature redraws on a theme switch; Dynamic Type at the largest size keeps the footer legible.

## 4. Wave 4 — Close-out (S)

- [ ] 4.1 CI green on every wave PR; `openspec validate rebrand-to-jirkas-arc --strict` passes. *`openspec validate --strict` passes (2026-09-28); CI not run yet (branch not pushed).*
- [x] 4.2 Identifier check: confirm by diff that no bundle id, URL scheme, Keychain service, BG task id, store path, alternate icon name or card id changed. *Checked 2026-09-28 by diff against the planning commit: the only removed identifier-like lines are the export file name (intended, D2) and `AppRouter.Tab`'s cases (now `ShellTab`, same cases plus `plan`).*

## 5. On-device verification (owner, AltStore update in place)

- [ ] 5.1 Before updating: note the current icon choice, placed widgets and Controls, the sync queue count, and Settings → About.
- [ ] 5.2 After updating: the home screen says "Jirka's Arc" (untruncated) in English and in Czech; the chosen alternate icon shows the arc; all data present; Garmin still signed in (no sign-in banner); widgets and Controls still placed and working; About shows "2.0 (<run number>)". Record anything that had to be re-added.
- [ ] 5.3 Export a backup: the file is `JirkasArc-backup-<date>.json`; import an old `GarminFood-backup-…json`: the preview opens.
- [ ] 5.4 Siri: "Log the usual in Jirka's Arc" in English and the Czech phrase on a Czech phone. If Siri doesn't recognise the name, add `INAlternativeAppNames` (design Risks) and re-check.
- [ ] 5.5 The fiancée's phone (her next update): standalone, food-first, three tabs, nothing changed but the name, icon and version.
