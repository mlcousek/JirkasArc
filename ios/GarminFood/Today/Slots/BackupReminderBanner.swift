// BackupReminderBanner.swift
//
// add-data-safety D6 (and add-standalone-mode 6.3, in both modes): a quiet
// Today banner when the last export is older than 14 days, or there has
// never been one, and the reminder wasn't dismissed in the last 14 days.
// The phone's own daily snapshots are deleted with the app, so only an
// exported file survives a reinstall or a lost phone -- that's what this
// nudges towards. Since add-vault-backup a backup that reached the vault in
// the last 14 days counts as that copy too, so the banner stays away while
// the weekly vault backup works and returns when it has stopped.
//
// "Export" opens the Data screen in a sheet (where Export lives, with its
// note about entries still waiting for Garmin); "Not now" hides it for 14
// days. The rule is `BackupReminderPolicy.shouldShow` (FoodLogCore,
// unit-tested); the two dates are UserDefaults keys that backups exclude,
// so restoring an old backup never rewinds them.
//
// Depends on: FoodLogCore (BackupReminderPolicy), DataSettingsView.
// Depended on by: TodaySlotHost.
