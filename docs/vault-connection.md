# Vault connection

How the app connects to the owner's Obsidian vault on GitHub, what it can
and cannot do there, and how to create, rotate and revoke the token. The
design is `openspec/changes/archive/2026-10-07-add-vault-connection/` (design D1–D13); the
code is `ios/VaultKit` (the wire layer) and `ios/GarminFood/Vault` (the
screens).

This repository is public. Nothing here, in the code, in CI or in a test
fixture names the vault's repository or contains a token. The repository
is typed in on the phone.

## What the app does with GitHub

| | Path (relative to `Sport/Training/_hub` in the vault) | When |
|---|---|---|
| Reads | `projection/projection.v1.json` | On foreground, at most once a minute while the connection is on (pull to refresh skips the minute). A conditional GET: an unchanged file costs a `304` with no body. |
| Reads | the repository itself (`GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}`) | "Test connection", and once after the plan file first answers `404`, to tell "no plan yet" from "repository not found". |
| Writes | `events/<this phone's device id>/<yyyy>/<mm>/<yyyymmddThhmmssZ>-<firstSeq>.jsonl` | Since `add-training-checkins`: the training events recorded on the phone (morning check-in -- since `add-checkin-pain-score` with the morning pain score --, habit ticks, RPE, notes; since `add-plan-editing` also plan changes -- move, swap, skip, unskip, a rule override -- and their withdrawal), sealed into one JSON Lines file per delivery, on foreground, on leaving the app and two minutes after an action. Only once "Test connection" has succeeded (the device id names the folder). Writes are create-only: an existing file is never overwritten. |
| Writes | `backups/<this phone's device id>/<YYYY>/<YYYY>-W<ww>.json.gz` | Since `add-vault-backup`: a backup of the app's own data, once per ISO week (see "The weekly backup" below). Create-only too. "Back up now" in a week that already has its file writes `<YYYY>-W<ww>-<yyyymmdd>T<hhmmss>Z.json.gz` beside it. |
| Reads | the same backup file | Only after GitHub answered a create with "already exists" (422): one read to see that the file is really there before the week is called done. Its content is not compared. |

Everything else is refused before a request is built (`VaultPathPolicy`):
another phone's events or backups folder, anything outside the hub, daily
notes, scripts, paths with `..`, encoded characters or backslashes. A
refusal is logged as an error in Settings → Diagnostics (category `vault`).

Other rules the app keeps:

- Only `https://api.github.com`. A redirect to any other host is refused,
  so the token never follows it.
- No request while the connection is off, on a standalone install, or
  after GitHub rejected the token or the repository (until you save a new
  token, fix the repository or tap "Try again").
- Rate limits (`429`, or `403` with rate-limit headers) pause all vault
  requests until GitHub's reset time. Offline and server errors are
  retried later. None of these show a banner.
- Nothing on screen ever waits for GitHub, and no food, weight or water
  entry depends on it.

## The blast radius, stated plainly

GitHub cannot limit a token to a path. A fine-grained token with
"Contents: Read and write" on the vault repository can read and write
**any file in that repository**, including scripts the desktop runs. The
app's path policy limits the app's own bugs; it does not limit someone who
steals the token. What limits that:

- the token is fine-grained, limited to **one** repository, with
  **Contents** as its only permission, and it expires;
- it lives only in this iPhone's Keychain, "after first unlock, this device
  only": not in iCloud Keychain, not in device backups, not on a restored
  phone;
- it is never logged, never in an error message, never in a snapshot or an
  exported backup (the backup scan also drops any file or preference that
  contains a GitHub token prefix: `github_pat_`, `ghp_`, `gho_`, `ghu_`,
  `ghs_`, `ghr_`);
- the vault side guards its own executable paths when it pulls (the
  vault's planning note; outside this repository's reach);
- a later change (`harden-vault-transport`) can replace direct GitHub
  access with an iCloud Drive bridge, after which the phone holds no vault
  credential at all.

If the phone is lost or the token may have leaked: **revoke it on
github.com first** (below). That is the kill switch; everything else is
secondary.

## Creating the token

On github.com: Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens →
**Fine-grained tokens** → Generate new token (the app's "Create a token on
GitHub" link opens this page).

1. **Token name**: something you'll recognise, e.g. "iPhone vault".
2. **Expiration**: 180 days (the app warns in its last 14 days).
3. **Resource owner**: your account.
4. **Repository access**: **Only select repositories** → the vault
   repository. Nothing else.
5. **Permissions** → Repository permissions → **Contents: Read and
   write**. Leave everything else at "No access" (Metadata: Read is added
   automatically).
6. Generate, copy the token (it starts with `github_pat_`).

Classic tokens (`ghp_…`) are refused: they can't be limited to one
repository.

## Connecting the phone

Settings → Vault (shown only on the Garmin-connected install):

1. Turn on "Connect to my vault".
2. Type the repository's owner and name (the branch is under "Advanced";
   `main` unless you point the phone at a test branch), then "Save
   repository".
3. Paste the token (the Paste button avoids the paste prompt), then "Save
   token". From then on Settings shows only its last four characters.
4. "Test connection": token accepted, repository reachable, plan file
   found (or "No plan data yet" — information, not an error), and the
   token's expiry if GitHub reports it. The first successful test creates
   this phone's device id (Settings → Vault → Details).

## Rotating the token

Before the old one expires (the banner starts 14 days before): create a new
token as above, paste it in Settings → Vault, "Save token", "Test
connection". Then delete the old token on github.com.

## Revoking and disconnecting

- **Revoke**: github.com → Settings → Developer settings → Personal access
  tokens → Fine-grained tokens → the token → Delete. The app shows "Vault
  token expired or revoked" on its next foreground and stops sending
  requests.
- **Disconnect** (Settings → Vault → Disconnect): deletes the token from
  the Keychain, clears the cached plan and the status, and turns the
  connection off. The device id is kept, so reconnecting writes into the
  same folder. Disconnecting does not revoke the token on GitHub — do both
  if the token should never work again.

## The weekly backup

Since `add-vault-backup` (design:
`openspec/changes/add-vault-backup/design.md`) the app saves a copy of its
own data into the vault, so a lost phone, a wiped container or a build that
will not launch does not lose what was logged.

- **What**: exactly the file Settings → Data → "Export backup" writes,
  gzip-compressed. Closed food days, custom foods, meal presets,
  favourites, weigh-ins, drinks, day notes, supplements, the gamification
  state and the preferences. Not in it: anything in the Keychain (the
  Garmin sign-in, the vault token), the device id, the cached plan, the
  queues of entries still waiting for Garmin or the vault, the diagnostics
  log, the offline food index. The training events (check-ins, habit
  ticks, RPE, plan edits) are not in it either: they already live in the
  vault under `events/`.
- **Where**: `Sport/Training/_hub/backups/<device id>/<YYYY>/<YYYY>-W<ww>.json.gz`
  in the vault repository. `<YYYY>` is the ISO week-numbering year and
  `<ww>` the ISO week, both in UTC. One file per week, never overwritten.
- **When**: at the first opportunity of each ISO week, when the app comes
  to the foreground (after the training events were delivered) or in a
  background refresh, and only while the event upload could run too: the
  connection on and tested, a token, no loud problem, no rate-limit pause,
  on the Garmin-connected install.
- **When it fails**: quietly. Settings → Vault → Backup shows the last
  problem; the next attempt is an hour later at the earliest, and after
  five failed attempts in a week the week is skipped. Being offline, a
  rejected token, a rate limit, a conflict with another commit made at the
  same moment (GitHub's 409 -- the phone's own event upload can cause it)
  and an upload iOS cut off do not count. The next week's file holds everything anyway. When no backup
  has reached the vault for 14 days, Today's "Keep a copy of your data"
  banner is back.
- **How large**: a few hundred kilobytes. A backup above 3 MiB is not
  uploaded and Settings says so. Every file stays in the vault's git
  history, so old ones are worth pruning on the desk now and then.
- **By hand**: Settings → Vault → "Back up now". In a week that already
  has its file this writes a second, time-stamped one, so there is always
  a current copy before an update or a restore.

### Restoring from the vault

1. Get the newest file of the phone's folder onto the iPhone: from the
   vault folder in Files, or download it from the repository's page on
   github.com. A reinstalled app or a new phone has a new device id, so
   look in the old id's folder.
2. Settings → Data → "Import backup…", pick the `.json.gz` file as it is
   (unpacked with `gunzip` or 7-Zip it is the plain export, which imports
   too).
3. Check the preview, confirm, then close the app and open it again. The
   data on the phone is saved as a safety backup first.
4. Sign in to Garmin again and paste the vault token again: neither is in
   any backup.

## Backups

Backups (snapshots, exports and the weekly vault backup) carry the
connection **settings** (`vault.connection.v1`: on/off, owner, name,
branch) and nothing else: never the token (Keychain only), never the
device id, the status, the cached plan, the write queue or the weekly
backup's own bookkeeping (`VaultKit/` is excluded). After restoring on a
new phone the connection is configured but has no token; the banner asks
you to paste it again, and the new phone gets its own device id on its
first successful test.

## Probing GitHub from the PC

`tools/probe-github-contents.mjs` records, read-only, what GitHub actually
returns (status codes, whether an ETag comes back, the 304, the expiry
header's name and format, rate-limit header names). It reads the token and
the repository only from the `VAULT_PROBE_TOKEN` and `VAULT_PROBE_REPO`
environment variables, sends only GET requests and prints no body, no token
and no repository name. Run it on your own PC, never in CI; copy what it
prints into the change's design.md "Evidence", dated.
