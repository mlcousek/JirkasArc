// GamificationFeature.swift
//
// The plug-in seam (design D7) every wave-2 gamification feature (bingo,
// seasonal events, collections, journeys, records, secrets, sport & body,
// boss) implements, so each ships as its own files without editing the
// engine: the app's `FeatureHost` builds one `FeatureContext` per refresh /
// confirm, calls `update` on every registered feature, and applies the
// returned `FeatureUpdate` -- idempotent grants via `RewardLedger`, badge
// unlocks via `AchievementStore`, moments into the celebration queue.
//
// Features are actors (own JSON stores under
// `GamificationStorage.directory()/features/<featureId>/`), hence
// `AnyObject, Sendable` and an `async` update. `featureId`/`badges` are
// static facts a conforming actor declares `nonisolated`, so the
// Achievements screen can list badges without awaiting anything.
//
// Display text inside `FeatureMoment`/`FeatureSummary` is produced by the
// feature itself (already localized); nothing here persists it.
//
// Depends on: FoodLogCore (SignalsSnapshot, SupplementSignals), StreakEngine.Status,
// AchievementDefinition.
// Depended on by: GamificationFeatureRegistry, RewardLedger, the app's
// FeatureHost/MomentOverlay, every wave-2 feature.
