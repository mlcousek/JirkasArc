// BingoEvaluator.swift
//
// add-weekly-bingo design D4 + D5: which squares of a card are done and
// which lines that makes. Pure, over `SignalsSnapshot`, so every rule is
// testable with literal `DaySignals`.
//
// - Only the card's own ISO week counts, and only up to `today`: fish
//   logged the Sunday before a card's Monday never ticks that card.
// - A day-scoped square records the FIRST day of the week its rule held; a
//   week-scoped one the first day the week-so-far satisfied it.
// - Sticky: completions are merged into the stored ones, never removed, so
//   deleting the entry that ticked a square leaves it done (and rewards are
//   never taken back).
// - A stored id that is no longer in the catalog is treated as FREE
//   (defensive -- ids are never removed on purpose).
//
// add-training-gamification-and-150-levels D9: a `.training` square is
// judged from the plan's facts (`plan`, passed only in the training
// experience) by `trainingCompletionDay`; without them it simply stays
// open. Everything else is unchanged.
//
// Depends on: BingoTaskCatalog, SignalEvaluator, WeekKey, FoodLogCore.
// Depended on by: WeeklyBingoFeature, BingoCardGenerator (lines),
// WeeklyBingoEvaluatorTests.
