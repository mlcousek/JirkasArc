// OpenEnum.swift
//
// The contract's consumer rule "decode unknown enum values as unknown"
// (design D2). Every enumeration the projection carries -- sport, session
// type, status, option code, step kind, habit state and so on -- is read
// through `OpenEnum<Known>`: a value this build knows becomes `.known`,
// anything else `.unknown(raw)`, and decoding never throws for a new value.
// So the vault can add a session type (`"hike"`) or a status without
// breaking an older app; the screens show such a value neutrally.
//
// `aliases` lets one enum accept a second spelling of the same value (the
// habit schedule kinds, written camelCase in the contract and snake_case in
// some planning notes, design D3).
//
// Depended on by: Projection.swift (every model). Tests: ContractPrimitivesTests.
