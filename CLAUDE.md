# GarminFood (the app is "Jirka's Arc")

**Naming.** The app is called **Jirka's Arc** (repository, targets and
identifiers still named GarminFood) since `rebrand-to-jirkas-arc`: only the
display name (`APP_DISPLAY_NAME` in `ios/project.yml`), the icon and
user-facing text say "Jirka's Arc". Bundle ids, the `garminfood` URL scheme,
Keychain services, the BG task id, store paths, the backup marker, theme-code
prefix, alternate icon names, layout card ids, Swift type names and every
path in this file keep "GarminFood" -- a new bundle id on a free Personal
Team is a new app with an empty container. Rule for new code: identifiers
and storage say GarminFood; user-facing text says Jirka's Arc (ASCII
apostrophe, the same in Czech).

**Two experiences** (AppearanceKit `AppExperience`/`AppShell`): food-first
(Today, Progress, Profile -- the default and the only one without a vault
connection) and training (Today, Plan, Progress, Profile). `AppShell` is the
single source of the tab set, the start tab and route targets.

A personal iOS food-tracking app (Jiří's own Garmin account) — fast logging, a
streak, levels, challenges — with Garmin Connect as the system of record,
since Garmin has no public write API for nutrition. Talks to Garmin's private
mobile API (`connectapi.garmin.com`), which is undocumented and unversioned.
Personal-use interop with the owner's own account/data only.

## Read first

- [`openspec/config.yaml`](openspec/config.yaml) — hard constraints, ground
  truth from live-probing Garmin's API, conventions, Design & UX principles.
  This is the actual source of truth; treat it as more current than this file
  for anything it covers.
- [`README.md`](README.md) — the OpenSpec change list and what's verified vs
  not. Partially stale (references screens/files renamed or removed since it
  was written — e.g. the home screen is now `Today/TodayView.swift`, not
  `Home/TodayHeroView.swift`) — prefer reading actual code over this file.
- [`docs/garmin-food-log-contract.md`](docs/garmin-food-log-contract.md) and
  [`docs/garmin-routes.json`](docs/garmin-routes.json) — the private-API route
  registry, each entry dated with when it was last confirmed working.

## Hard constraints (do not violate)

- **No Mac.** Swift cannot be built or tested on this Windows machine — no
  `swift`/`xcodebuild` locally. All verification happens in CI
  (`.github/workflows/build.yml`, hosted macOS runners) after pushing a
  branch/PR, or by sideloading a build to a real iPhone via AltServer/
  AltStore. Write code carefully (it can't be locally compiled first); lean
  on `swift test` in CI for the pure-logic packages.
- **Free Apple Developer account, no paid team.** No App Groups, no Keychain
  Sharing (confirmed blocked, `errSecMissingEntitlement`), no Push/iCloud/
  HealthKit. Every process (app, widget extension) bootstraps its own Garmin
  login independently — there is no shared state between them.
- **Garmin's private API can break without notice.** Every route this project
  depends on is recorded in `docs/garmin-routes.json` with a last-verified
  date. A new dependency on an unconfirmed route must be clearly marked as
  such in code comments and gated behind explicit user action if it writes
  data (see `GarminClient.createCustomFood`'s doc comment for the pattern).
- **Local-first, zero-network-wait.** A logged entry is durably committed to
  a local outbox file and shown to the user immediately; Garmin delivery
  happens after, via `Outbox.drain`, never blocking the confirm action. Don't
  add a network `await` to any confirm/save path that today completes purely
  from local state.
- **Auth failures are loud; everything else degrades quietly.** Silent auth
  failure is a real incident this project already had once (the Obsidian
  vault's sync). A failed delivery/retry must surface to the user somewhere
  (see `SyncQueueView`).

## Architecture

```
ios/
  GarminKit/       SPM package — OAuth1 signing, token bootstrap, GarminClient
                    (the wire layer), Outbox (durable local queue),
                    Reconciliation. No UI, no domain concepts like "meal".
                    The food Outbox also owns the DELETE queue
                    (improve-food-day-flow, FoodLogDeletionQueue.swift:
                    its own record and file, `food-delete-outbox-<process>
                    .json`): deleting a synced entry is saved on the phone
                    first and delivered later (a 404 is "already gone"),
                    retried and account-scoped like every queue. Creates
                    are sent and re-read BEFORE deletes.
  FoodLogCore/      SPM package (depends on GarminKit) — the domain layer:
                    Food/Serving, CustomFood, MealDashboard (Today screen's
                    data), LogEntryCoordinator (the confirm-and-commit
                    action), UsageHistory/ServingDefaults (quick-pick
                    ranking, remembered servings), FoodSearchEngine (one
                    ranked, Czech-aware search over your own foods, Garmin
                    and Open Food Facts: SearchText/CzechLightStemmer/
                    SearchRanker/SearchDedup; Local/Garmin/OpenFoodFacts
                    sources; golden suite in SearchRelevanceTests),
                    OpenFoodFactsClient, and the offline Czech OFF index
                    (OfflineFoodIndex/OfflineCzechIndexSource/
                    OfflineIndexStore; built weekly by
                    tools/build-czech-food-index + food-index.yml).
                    Also the pure rules of the screenless surfaces
                    (add-training-shortcuts-and-widgets), because the
                    widget links this package and nothing in Shared/ or a
                    widget can be unit-tested: QuickHealthLog (what a
                    weigh-in or a drink without its sheet may record),
                    BoundedWait, EventCountdown (the countdown widget's
                    calendar days).
                    improve-food-day-flow: MealDashboard overlays queued
                    deletes (`MealEntry.deletion`: "Deleting…" off the
                    totals, "Couldn't delete" counted again);
                    QuickLogShelfPolicy (the quick-log shelves follow the
                    day shown); FoodDayClose.swift ("That's everything
                    today": a per-day LOCAL store, "Edited after closing"
                    set by the app's own changes, and a complete-days
                    streak beside the one-entry streak); FuelDay's single
                    carb target and race name on a carb-load day.
  Gamification/     SPM package (depends on FoodLogCore) — streaks, XP/levels,
                    daily/rotating challenges, achievements. App-only, not
                    linked into the widget extension. 150 levels
                    (add-training-gamification-and-150-levels): the curve's
                    factor is SOLVED from the XP budget (XPBudget + Features/
                    Training/TrainingXPBudget) and pinned by XPBudgetTests;
                    tools/level-curve-model.mjs mirrors both tables and
                    prints the numbers -- change a reward in both places.
                    Training XP (Features/Training/): the app copies
                    TrainingCore's TrainingPlanFacts into TrainingPlanSignals,
                    TrainingXPRules judges them. One rule above all: reward
                    following the plan and honest self-monitoring, never
                    doing more (no XP per km, per extra session, for hard
                    days in a row or for training through a red morning;
                    rest days and wise stops pay like training days).
  VaultKit/         SPM package (depends on GarminKit) — the GitHub wire layer
                    to the owner's Obsidian vault (add-vault-connection):
                    fine-grained token in the Keychain, VaultPathPolicy
                    allow-lists, conditional fetch (ConditionalFileSync),
                    generic DurableQueue + create-only uploads, and the
                    VaultTransport seam. No training concepts, no
                    user-facing strings. App-only, never the widget.
                    add-vault-backup: the weekly backup of the app's own
                    data (VaultBackup.swift: the ISO week in UTC, the path
                    `backups/<deviceId>/<YYYY>/<YYYY>-W<ww>.json.gz`, due
                    once a week, an hour between attempts, five counted
                    failures a week, a 3 MiB cap; VaultBackupUploader:
                    create-only, "already exists" means the week is done
                    once one read has SEEN the file -- a bare 422 is never
                    believed, the content is never compared -- and it
                    does NOT go through the DurableQueue). VaultKit is
                    handed bytes: FoodLogCore's
                    Backup/BackupArchive.swift builds them (the export,
                    gzip-compressed; `BackupContainer.decode` reads both
                    forms, so restore is the existing import) and
                    GarminFood/Vault/VaultBackupService.swift joins the
                    two, behind the gate the event upload uses.
  TrainingCore/     SPM package (depends on VaultKit, GarminKit) — the
                    training domain (add-training-today-and-plan): tolerant
                    decoding of the vault's projection v1 (OpenEnum,
                    LossyArray, LocalizedText, LocalDate/ISOWeek), the last
                    good plan and its freshness (ProjectionStore), the
                    training day, and pure view models + formatters for
                    Today's training cards and the Plan tab (week, month,
                    season timeline, phase, race prep, statistics --
                    add-season-phase-race-screens, add-training-stats), in English and
                    Czech (lproj via TrainingText/TrainingKey). Golden-tested
                    on the vault's two contract fixtures, mirrored verbatim
                    under Tests/.../Fixtures/Contract/vault. Never SwiftUI.
                    App-only, never the widget. Events/ (add-training-
                    checkins): the app's writes -- HubEvent (the envelope v1,
                    the ONLY file that knows the wire format; golden JSONL
                    fixture), TrainingEventLog (the local outbox, durable
                    before anything else), EventSegment (sealed JSONL into
                    the device's own folder via VaultKit's write queue),
                    CheckInOverlay (latest wins, merged over the
                    projection), TrainingRecorder, TrainingReminderPlanner.
                    The app's one recorder is GarminFood/Training/
                    TrainingEventsService; the lock-screen check-in
                    Controls, the Home Screen check-in widget and the
                    "Morning check-in" App Shortcut all reach it through
                    ONE hook (Shared/MorningCheckInIntents.swift; the
                    widget's buttons have their own thin intent there,
                    because a widget button can't show an error -- the app
                    shows it once instead). Events/QuickCheckIn.swift
                    decides what such a check-in records: a shortcut's
                    single pain number, and a repeat of the day's light,
                    which is NOT a second event (the vault takes the last
                    check-in's light, session and option)
                    (add-training-shortcuts-and-widgets). Plan edits (add-plan-
                    editing): the plan.* commands and event.retracted are
                    in HubEvent too; PlanEditPolicy (what may be asked --
                    never a race, a past day or another week) builds them,
                    PendingOverlay (PlanCommandOverlay.swift) previews the
                    unacknowledged ones over the projection and reads the
                    vault's `outcomes`; the session detail's "Change the
                    plan" card (GarminFood/Plan/PlanEditViews.swift).
                    Morning pain (add-checkin-pain-score): `pains` on the
                    check-in and on each projection day (Contract/
                    Pain.swift), kept or replaced like the vault does
                    (CheckInOverlay), the pain step and tags
                    (ViewModels/PainModels.swift). Every day
                    (add-daily-checkin-and-pain-mode): the projection's
                    top-level `days` are day skeletons for the dates no
                    written week holds (also with `plan: null`);
                    `TrainingSnapshot.day(_:)` is THE lookup of a date (a
                    week's day, else its skeleton) -- never
                    `plan?.day(date)` in a consumer. `day.fuel` is on every
                    day: a carb-load day is `DayFuel.isCarbLoad`, never
                    "fuel is not nil". Pain features show only in pain mode
                    (Plan/PainModeState.swift: the vault's
                    `athlete.painMode`, or this phone's unread pain answer
                    above 0); outside it the check-in is the light plus a
                    "Something hurts?" link. The check-in reminder is
                    planned every day, at the owner's times
                    (`TrainingReminderTimes`). Gates, load and results
                    (add-training-gates-and-load): the vault's
                    `athlete.gate` / `.recovery`, the load fields of
                    `week.actual`, `done.manual`, `feedback.pains` / `.fuel`,
                    race `result` and `notices` (Contract/
                    LoadAndResults.swift), and five more facts in HubEvent
                    -- `test.gate`, `session.done`, `session.fuel`,
                    `race.result`, `pains` on `session.rpe` (golden:
                    gates.v1.app.jsonl = the vault example's own lines,
                    key-sorted). Models: GateModels (gate card in pain
                    mode, "the plan is the ceiling", recovery chip,
                    notices), SessionRecordModels (pain during/after, mark
                    done by hand, fuel log), RaceResultModels (the
                    organiser's `officialTime` is the result, the elapsed
                    `time` the second line). A race is looked up by `id`
                    (`TrainingSnapshot.race(id:)`), never by position; a
                    missing number is unknown ("–"), never 0; the gate's
                    verdict, the caps, grams per hour, "goal reached" and
                    the recovery window are the vault's -- never computed
                    here. The race rewards read the PUBLISHED result
                    (ProjectionRewardExtras / TrainingPlanFacts).
  GarminFood/       The app target (SwiftUI views), organized by screen:
                    Today/, Plan/, Training/, Catalog/, CustomFood/,
                    LogEntry/, Profile/, Progress/, App/ (composition root:
                    AppEnvironment.swift).
  GarminFoodWidget/ Widget/Control extension target. It cannot read anything
                    the app knows (no shared state, see Hard constraints),
                    so no surface shows the app's data: each one either
                    opens the app (`widgetURL`) or runs an intent that
                    executes IN the app (`openAppWhenRun`: every Control,
                    and the check-in widget's three `Button(intent:)`). The
                    only number a widget shows is the countdown's, computed
                    from that widget's OWN configuration (Edit Widget:
                    event name, date, theme) and today's date.
  Shared/           Compiled into BOTH the app and widget extension targets
                    (App Intents that must be nameable from a Control or a
                    widget button -- QuickPickLoggingIntents,
                    MorningCheckInIntents, QuickHealthLogIntents (weight
                    and water) -- plus AppServices.swift, the
                    one-instance-per-store composition root both processes
                    share within themselves). Nothing here may name an
                    app-only package (VaultKit, TrainingCore, Gamification):
                    the app installs a hook instead. Its strings go in BOTH
                    Localizable catalogs. App Shortcuts (Siri, Spotlight)
                    are declared in GarminFood/Shortcuts/
                    GarminFoodShortcuts.swift: seven of Apple's ten.
  project.yml       XcodeGen manifest — the source of truth for the Xcode
                    project. Sources are path-globbed per target, so a new
                    .swift file dropped into an existing target's folder is
                    picked up automatically; no project file to hand-edit.
```

Module boundary rule: UI (`GarminFood/`) never talks to `GarminKit` directly
for anything domain-shaped — it goes through `FoodLogCore` (e.g.
`LogEntryCoordinator`, not `Outbox`, from a view). `FoodLogCore` never imports
SwiftUI.

VaultKit keeps the same boundary for the vault: it knows GitHub's contents
API and nothing about sessions or plans. Everything above it depends on
`VaultTransport` (hub-relative paths), never on `GitHubContentsClient`;
only `GarminFood/Vault/VaultServices.swift` knows the transport is GitHub.
Every vault request goes through `VaultPathPolicy` first, and nothing may
log the token, the repository owner or its name (`VaultLog`,
`RedactionTests`). This repository is public: no vault repository name,
token or vault content in code, CI or fixtures. See
`docs/vault-connection.md`.

What the app writes to the vault, all of it create-only and inside its own
device folders under the hub root: the training events
(`events/<deviceId>/...jsonl`, add-training-checkins) and the weekly backup
of its own data (`backups/<deviceId>/<YYYY>/...json.gz`, add-vault-backup).
It reads `projection/` and, to check what it wrote, its own files. A new
kind of write means a new shape in `VaultPathPolicy` with its refused
shapes tested, never a looser rule. A backup must never contain a credential or device state:
`BackupExclusions` decides, and `VaultUploadArchiveTests` names the stores
that may not be flipped.

TrainingCore sits on top: the app's views reach the plan only through it
(`GarminFood/Training/TrainingModel.swift` holds its `TrainingSource`,
views draw its builders' models), never through VaultKit. **The phone never
computes what the vault computes** -- adherence, weekly volume (`actual`),
matching activities to sessions, the done option, gate status: all are
read from the projection. The training experience turns on with the vault
connection switch (on a Garmin-connected install); the food-first
experience has no training card at all.

`AppServices.swift` (`Shared/`) holds the one real instance of every JSON-file
store per process; `AppEnvironment.swift` (`GarminFood/App/`) is the SwiftUI
composition root that exposes them via `.environment(_:)`. Add a new store
there, not as a fresh instance inside a view.

Two smaller cross-cutting pieces worth knowing about:
- `GarminKit/DiagnosticsLog.swift` — a persistent, capped, in-app-visible
  log (viewable/copyable from Settings → Diagnostics). This exists because
  there's no Mac to attach a debugger or Console.app to; log real errors
  here (`DiagnosticsLog.log(.error, category:, "...")`), not just a generic
  user-facing message. Already wired into `GarminClient`'s two choke points
  and `Outbox.drain` — extend from there rather than adding new logging
  infra.
- `NotificationScheduler`/`NotificationPreferencesStore` (`GarminFood/App/`)
  + `FoodLogCore/NotificationPlanning.swift` — local reminders (meals,
  streak-at-risk, daily challenges), each re-planned fresh on every
  foreground/log/setting-change and diffed against what's actually pending,
  because a local notification can't check app state at fire time on its
  own. See `openspec/changes/add-reminders-and-diagnostics/design.md` for
  why.

## Conventions

- **OpenSpec.** Larger changes are planned under `openspec/changes/<name>/`
  (proposal.md, design.md, specs/, tasks.md) before/while being built, then
  archived to `openspec/changes/archive/`. Not every small fix goes through
  this ceremony (see the git log for plenty of direct bug-fix commits), but a
  new capability generally should, especially one with an unconfirmed Garmin
  route or real architectural surface.
- **Feature branches + PRs into `main`.** `git log --oneline` shows the
  pattern: `mlcousek/<change-name>` branches, merged via PR, CI green before
  merge.
- **Every `.swift` file starts with a header comment** explaining *why* it
  exists and what it depends on/is depended on by — not what the code
  obviously does. Match this style in new files; it's load-bearing given no
  local Xcode/Instruments to rediscover context by exploring interactively.
- **Pure logic lives in the SPM packages and is unit-tested there** (fast,
  runs in CI with no simulator). UI code in `GarminFood/`/`GarminFoodWidget/`
  is not unit-tested (no local way to run XCTest against it meaningfully
  without previews/simulator) — keep it thin, push logic down into
  `FoodLogCore`/`Gamification` so it's actually verifiable.
- **Localization (English + Czech, more later).** All new user-facing text
  is localizable and translated from day one — see
  `openspec/changes/add-localization/design.md` and
  `docs/localization-analysis.md`:
  - App/widget: fixed copy as string *literals* in SwiftUI APIs
    (`Text("…")`, `Label`, `.navigationTitle`, …, which are keys), or
    `String(localized: "…")` when a `String` must be built; never
    `Text(someEnglishString)` for fixed copy. Add the key + Czech to
    `GarminFood/Resources/Localizable.xcstrings` (or the widget's). Keys are
    the English text; `Int` → `%lld`, `Double` → `%lf`, `String` → `%@`.
  - Packages: `String(localized: "…", bundle: .module, comment: "…")`, with
    the key in BOTH `Resources/en.lproj` and `Resources/cs.lproj`
    `Localizable.strings` (`.stringsdict` for plurals) — not `.xcstrings`,
    which `swift test` can't compile.
  - Counts use plural variations (Czech: one/few/many/other), never
    `n == 1 ? … : …`; no sentences glued from translated fragments; stores
    persist ids, never display text; `DiagnosticsLog` stays English.
  - `node tools/check-localizations.mjs` (CI job `localization`) must pass.
- **Test file/helper conventions**: see `FoodLogCoreTests/LogEntryCoordinatorTests.swift`
  for the pattern — real `GarminKit.Outbox`/store instances pointed at a
  unique temp file per test (never mocked), `XCTest`, one assertion group per
  behavior.

## Verifying a change

There is no local build. After editing Swift:

1. Sanity-check syntax by reading it back carefully — no compiler to catch
   typos here.
2. Push a branch and open a PR (or push to a branch with a workflow_dispatch)
   so `.github/workflows/build.yml` runs `swift test` for each touched
   package and `xcodebuild` for the app + widget. That is the actual
   correctness signal.
3. For anything touching a Garmin write route, the request/response shape is
   probably unconfirmed — say so in a comment (see `GarminClient.
   createCustomFood`'s header) and never let it run without an explicit user
   action, per `openspec/config.yaml`'s task rule: "Never include a task that
   writes to the Garmin account before the write contract is documented."
4. Real-device verification (does it actually work against the live Garmin
   account) only happens when the owner sideloads a build via AltStore and
   reports back — flag in the PR/commit message what still needs that.
