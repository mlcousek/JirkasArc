// TrainingReminderPlanner.swift
//
// Which training reminders should be pending right now
// (add-training-checkins design D8; the architecture note's section 6.3):
//
//   - morning: "How do you feel today?" on EVERY day of the window that
//     has no check-in yet -- the phone's own or the vault's light
//     (add-daily-checkin-and-pain-mode: it used to be planned only on a
//     day with a G/A/R session, so an unwritten week or a rest day never
//     asked). Its body is short ("Green, amber or red?"); in pain mode it
//     asks for the pain score too;
//   - evening: "Evening habits" on each of those days that expects habits
//     not all ticked (the phone's tick, else the vault's count, decision
//     A42). A day skeleton carries the expected habits of a day outside
//     the written weeks, so this works there too.
//
// Pure, like FoodLogCore's NotificationPlanning: the app's
// NotificationScheduler re-plans on every foreground, check-in and tick and
// diffs against what is pending (identifier prefix `training.`), because a
// local notification can't ask at fire time whether it is still needed. A
// reminder whose time has passed is left out. Nothing is planned without a
// loaded projection, or when the capabilities don't allow recording (no
// device id). A plan is NOT needed: the check-in works without one.
//
// fix-review-findings-2026-09 finding 11: `days` widens the window beyond
// today and tomorrow (the app passes a week, planned from the cached
// projection), so reminders keep firing while the app stays closed; the
// next replan still removes any a check-in or tick makes unneeded.
//
// add-daily-checkin-and-pain-mode: the two times are the owner's
// (`TrainingReminderTimes`, set in the notification settings; 04:05 and
// 20:10 by default).
//
// improve-food-day-flow (A2): the evening reminder also asks to close the
// food log on a day whose food log is not closed. The app passes the closed
// days (`closedFoodDays`, from FoodLogCore's store -- this package never
// reads it); without them the body is what it always was. The reminder is
// still planned only for a day with habits left to tick.
//
// Depended on by: the app's TrainingModel and NotificationScheduler.
// Tests: CheckInBuilderTests, DailyCheckInTests, FoodLogHabitTests.
