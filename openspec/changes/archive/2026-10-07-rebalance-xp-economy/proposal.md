## Why

Since 2026-09-24 the app gained nine gamification features: seasonal
events, collections, journeys, records, sport & body, secrets, bingo, the
weekly boss and streak freezes. `add-supplements` will add another XP source.
`add-gamification-signals` D10 retuned the level curve once (growth
1.045 → 1.0505) using an **estimate** of about 31 extra XP/day. That estimate
came from the *designs*, and several shipped amounts differ from them. For
example, sport & body pays no XP of its own (only the generic badge bonus).
(An earlier draft of this proposal said bingo's full card pays 350 XP. The
audit found it pays 150, exactly as designed.)

The owner wants levelling to keep **the same pace as now**: every new source
must not add up to a faster climb. They said *"we will also need to edit
gamification again to not level up that fast"*. Tuning by hand each time a
feature lands doesn't scale, so the pace becomes an explicit, tested budget.

## What Changes

- **A pure XP-budget model (`XPBudget`)** in the Gamification package.
  - Every XP source declares its expected XP for a "typical active day"
    through a small, reviewable table: flat per-log XP, streak XP,
    challenges, daily challenges, and each wave-2 feature, plus supplements
    when that feature is on.
  - The model sums the table into an expected XP/day.
- **The level curve is derived from the budget.** `LevelCurve.growthFactor`
  is solved (closed form or bisection, at build or test time) so that a
  typical day reaches **level 84 in 3 years**, matching the original
  2026-09-18 promise. A unit test pins the solved factor and fails when a
  new source is added without updating the budget.
- **Optional features count only when enabled.** Supplements (off by
  default) add their budget line only when switched on. The curve is
  computed from the always-on budget. Optional sources are scaled with an
  **XP multiplier** (design D4) so that together they add at most 0.5% of the
  core budget, and switching a feature on doesn't change the pace.
- **Levels never drop.** Existing `peakLevel` handling carries over: a
  steeper curve never lowers a displayed level. A one-time migration seeds
  `peakLevel` from the current factor before the new one applies.
- **Retune shipped amounts where they're out of line** (design D3's rule:
  no single wave-2 feature above 25% of the core budget), so one feature
  can't dominate the budget. The audit found none over the line, so no
  constants changed. A test now enforces the rule.

## Capabilities

### New Capabilities

- `xp-economy` - an explicit, tested XP budget that keeps levelling at a
  fixed pace however many XP sources exist.

### Modified Capabilities

(none; `LevelCurve`'s determinism and the never-lower-a-level rule are
unchanged)

## Non-goals

- New XP sources or rewards. Those belong to each feature's own change
  (e.g. `add-supplements`).
- A per-day XP cap. The owner explicitly chose calibration over a cap.
- Changing badge rarities, challenge difficulty or streak rules.

## Impact

- Gamification package: `LevelCurve.swift`, new `XPBudget.swift`, feature
  reward constants, and `XPStore` peak-level migration. The app only changes
  where it shows "XP to next level" (no API change).
- **Depends on**: all wave-2 gamification changes being merged (done
  2026-09-25).
- **Unblocks**: `add-supplements` (its supplement XP is priced through this
  budget).
