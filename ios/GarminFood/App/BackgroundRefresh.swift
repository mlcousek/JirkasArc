// BackgroundRefresh.swift

// Delivers queued entries while the app isn't open (add-garmin-auth-and-sync
// 9.5, design D10). iOS decides when, and whether, a refresh actually runs.
// For a sideloaded app that is a device check, not an assumption. The
// foreground drain keeps working regardless. It also runs the Czech
// offline index's daily update check (add-offline-czech-food-index) and,
// on a Garmin-connected install, the weekly vault backup when one is due
// (add-vault-backup).
