# garmin-food-matching Specification

## Purpose
Keep Garmin as the single system of record when logging a food that originated from the Czech (Open Food Facts) catalog: find and use a real Garmin-side equivalent when one exists, and only ever create a new Garmin food with explicit user confirmation when it doesn't.

## Requirements

### Requirement: A Czech-database food is matched against Garmin's catalog before logging

The system SHALL search Garmin's food catalog for a candidate equivalent of a chosen Czech-database food, using a normalized name comparison, before offering to log or create anything.

#### Scenario: A clear equivalent exists in Garmin

- **WHEN** a chosen Czech-database food's normalized name closely matches a Garmin search result for the same term, and their calorie values are not wildly inconsistent
- **THEN** the system identifies it as a match candidate

#### Scenario: No reasonable equivalent exists

- **WHEN** no Garmin search result's normalized name reasonably matches the chosen food, or a name-similar candidate's calories differ by more than the matching tolerance
- **THEN** the system reports no match found

### Requirement: A found match is shown to the user, never logged silently

The system SHALL present any candidate match to the user for confirmation before logging against it — the match is a suggestion, not an automatic resolution.

#### Scenario: Confirming a suggested match

- **WHEN** the system finds a candidate Garmin match for a Czech-database food
- **THEN** the user sees the matched Garmin food's name and can confirm or reject it before it is logged

### Requirement: Creating a new Garmin food requires explicit confirmation and is never automatic

When no Garmin match exists, the system SHALL offer to create a new food in Garmin with the Czech-database food's values, but SHALL NOT send that creation request without the user explicitly confirming the exact values to be sent.

#### Scenario: No match exists and the user confirms creation

- **WHEN** no Garmin match was found and the user reviews and confirms the values to create
- **THEN** the system sends the creation request to Garmin and, on success, logs the newly created food

#### Scenario: No match exists and the user does not confirm

- **WHEN** no Garmin match was found and the user has not explicitly confirmed creation
- **THEN** no creation request is sent to Garmin under any circumstance

### Requirement: A custom food Garmin accepted is never created twice

The system SHALL treat any 2xx response to a custom-food create as a created food, whatever its body, and SHALL NOT offer another create from that screen afterwards. When the body can't be read, the user SHALL be told the food exists in Garmin and how to find it.

#### Scenario: 201 with an unexpected body
- **WHEN** Garmin answers the create with 201 and a body that isn't a food
- **THEN** the screen says the food was created but its details didn't come back, and the create button stays disabled

#### Scenario: Refused create
- **WHEN** Garmin answers with a non-2xx status
- **THEN** the error is shown and the user may try again
