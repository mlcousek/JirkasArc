### Requirement: Schedules decide what is due each day

The system SHALL compute each day's planned items from each product's

### Requirement: A daily checklist records intake locally without waiting for the network

days back. Every change SHALL be
committed to local storage and shown immediately, with no network request.

available only while the feature is on and at least one product exists. It
SHALL have a *current slot* variant (the next due slot with ticks and "Take
all", collapsing to a done state when the day is complete) and a *whole day*
variant (every slot as compact pills). Turning the feature off SHALL leave
the default Today order unchanged.

#### Scenario: Default order unaffected

- **WHEN** the feature has never been enabled
