// GamificationEngine.swift
//
// The app-layer orchestrator for `add-gamification`: owns the Gamification
// package's stores, recomputes streak/level/challenge display state, and
// decides what counts as a "moment" (level-up, streak milestone, challenge
// completion -- design.md D5) worth surfacing to the UI. Lives here, not in
// `Gamification` itself, because it genuinely needs GarminKit (`GarminClient`,
// for the one network read this feature needs -- see `refreshGoalStatus`
// below) and FoodLogCore (`UsageHistoryStore`) together, which the
// `Gamification` package deliberately does not depend on (Package.swift's
// header) or does not depend on at all (GarminKit). Mirrors
// `AppEnvironment`'s own "composition root, thin views" rationale.
//
// WHY THIS ISN'T INSIDE `LogEntryCoordinator` (FoodLogCore): proposal.md is
// explicit that gamification has NO "Modified Capabilities" -- it reads
// `add-food-log-core`'s local log history without requiring that capability
// to change. `LogEntryCoordinator.confirm`/`confirmCustomFood` are
// therefore untouched; `LogEntryConfirmView` calls this engine as a
// deliberate SECOND step immediately after the coordinator's call succeeds
// (see that file), the same way it already treats `drainAndReconcile()` as
// a separate, later step.
//
// add-winter-arc-nutrition-and-rewards: in the training experience (asked
// through `featureHost.isTrainingExperience`) goal status is judged by the
// plan day's carb band (`fuelTargetProvider`, FoodLogCore's
// `GoalStatusEvaluator.evaluate(_:fuel:)`), and challenges / daily
// challenges that judge the fixed calorie target are not offered
// (Gamification's TrainingExperienceAvailability). Food-first: unchanged.
