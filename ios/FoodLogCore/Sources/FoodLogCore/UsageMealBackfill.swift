// UsageMealBackfill.swift
//
// Fills in `UsageEvent.mealType` for usage events recorded before that
// field existed (2026-09-23), so the "Usual for <meal>" shelf
// (`MealUsualRanker`) isn't empty for weeks after the upgrade -- the owner's
// testing-feedback follow-up.
//
// Why from Garmin's day logs and not from the clock: `MealUsualRanker`
// deliberately refuses to guess a meal from the time of day (a 10pm snack
// would land on the dinner shelf). Garmin's own day log records which meal
// every food was actually logged under, so it is ground truth: an event is
// filled in only when its food appears in exactly ONE meal of that day's
// log. Anything ambiguous or not found stays `nil`, exactly as before.
//
// Pure functions over `[UsageEvent]` + `[day: DailyFoodLog]`, so they are
// unit-testable without I/O. The reads themselves (the confirmed
// `GET /nutrition-service/food/logs/{date}` route the Today tab uses) and
// the one-time trigger live in the app's `AppEnvironment`;
// `UsageHistoryStore.applyMealBackfill` persists the result.
//
// Depended on by: UsageHistory.swift (store method), AppEnvironment.
